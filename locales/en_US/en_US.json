However, while the relayers in the GSN do not charge users, they charge the recipient and contract instead. In this way, the relayers recover the costs of transactions and profit from extra fees for providing such services. Originally conceived and designed by TabooKey, the GSN has grown to encompass many companies, protocols and platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem that wish to facilitate the onboarding of users to Ethereum applications.

These are often referred to as \"airgapped\" or \"cold storage\" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a \"hot\" wallet, connected to the Internet, is \"ready to use on chain\", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.\"\r\nconfirmation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,\"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.\"\r\nconsensus,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs/,\"The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.\"\r\nconsensus client,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈklaɪənt/,\"A consensus client is a component of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network.

With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.\"\r\ncrypto-compliance,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-kəmˈplaɪəns/,A blanket term used to refer to ensuring crypto projects conform with applicable regulations and laws.\r\ncryptoassets,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊˌæsɛts/,\"A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products.\"\r\ncryptocurrency,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkrɪptəˈkɜrənsi/,\"Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds.

In modern times, it often refers to the application of this concept within computing, communication, and data transfer through computers and computer networks. Cryptography has been protected as free speech in the United States, and provides the technological foundation that allows blockchain networks to be public: despite the ledger being open and accessible by all, control over the state of the ledger and the ability to move assets on it is mediated through cryptographic tools, such as the Secret Recovery Phrase.\"\r\nDAO,noun,decentralized web,/daʊ/,Acronym; see 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization'.\r\ndapp,noun,decentralized web,/dæp/,Acronym; see 'decentralized application'\r\ndecentralization,noun,decentralized web,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlɪˈzeɪʃən/,\"The transfer of authority and responsibility from a centralized organization, government, or party to a distributed network.\"\r\ndecentralized application,noun,decentralized web,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlaɪzd ˌæplɪˈkeɪʃən/,\"An open-source software application with backend (not user-facing) code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, rather than a centralized server.

The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there are so-called on-ramp providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on deposit” the way a centralized exchange does.

In contrast to the current centralized web, where most online activities are controlled by a few large corporations and their servers, the decentralized web relies on a network of distributed nodes and peer-to-peer protocols to store and transmit data.

In general, attestation involves a trusted third-party, or attester, verifying the authenticity of a transaction or piece of information. This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

One of the key features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, which helps to prevent inflation and maintain the value of the currency. When referring to the overall network, capitalization is appropriate (Bitcoin), whereas when referring to the tokens themselves, lower-case is more appropriate (bitcoin).

This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

Soft Forks render two chains with some compatibility, while Hard Forks create a new version of the chain that must be adopted to continue participation.

Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network. For each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency.

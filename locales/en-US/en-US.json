The resulting smart contract itself has an account as well -- the public address which can be used to 'call', or access its methods -- that's the one we're calling, here, a 'contract account'. But don't worry, it gets significantly worse; at a certain point, new techniques began to be used, to 'abstract away' the difficulties involved in EOAs; this move towards 'account abstraction' resulted in the creation of end user-accessible, shall we say, accounts which are created and controlled by... Smart contracts (which, remember, have their own accounts). There was much soul-searching and hand-wringing in trying to figure out what to call these things; often, they are referred to as... *Smart Contract Accounts*, capitalized; that's SCA, for short.",

Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network.\n\nFor each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency.

Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network.\n\nFor each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency.

A few examples of popular relayers include 0x: 0x is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables the creation of relayers on the Ethereum blockchain. These relayers can be built by anyone and allow for peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nKyber Network: Kyber Network is a decentralized liquidity network that also operates as a relayer. It enables users to trade a wide range of digital assets, including ERC-20 tokens, without the need for a centralized intermediary.\n\nUniswap: Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange that operates as a relayer. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) system to enable peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.\n\nAirSwap: AirSwap is a decentralized exchange that operates as a peer-to-peer relayer on the Ethereum blockchain.

Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. However, this can result in a potential divide in the blockchain, as the old software generates blocks that read as invalid according to the new rules. Contrast with 'hard fork'; for more basic information regarding forks, see 'fork'.",

      "definition": "In an Ethereum wallet application like MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.",

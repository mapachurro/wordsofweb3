      "definition": "An attack, often discussed in purely theoretical terms, performed against a distributed ledger or blockchain network. /n The mechanism of the attack consists of gaining control of at least half -- more than 50% -- of the 'nodes' or 'peers' that participate in the network's consensus mechanism, i.e., sync the current state of the ledger. By gaining control of 51% of the network, the attacker could, in theory, maliciously rewrite the ledger for their own purposes. /n Solving for this attack vector is one of the key design decisions in the Bitcoin protocol, as well as Ethereum, and others. In the case of Bitcoin, this was solved through the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, wherein the difficulty involved in mining new blocks effectively prevents any one actor from gaining this sort of control.",

The private half, meanwhile, gives total control over the account; *total*. /n These public-private key pairs can be generated one at a time, or they can be *derived* from what is known as a **seed phrase** or **secret recovery phrase**; for more on this, see HD wallet."

      "definition": "On a distributed ledger or public blockchain network, an 'address', or 'public address', is an identifier that can be used to variously locate, identify, send or receive tokens to and from, different entities.

Smart contracts on those networks also have addresses, so that other contracts or protocols can interact with them. In Ethereum, the address begins with 0x; For example: 0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee",

Attestation is an important aspect of blockchain technology, as it helps to ensure the integrity and security of the network. In general, attestation involves a trusted third-party, or attester, verifying the authenticity of a transaction or piece of information. This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

51% attack
noun
An attack, often discussed in purely theoretical terms, performed against a distributed ledger or blockchain network.   The mechanism of the attack consists of gaining control of at least half – more than 50% – of the 'nodes' or 'peers' that participate in the network's consensus mechanism, i.e., sync the current state of the ledger. By gaining control of 51% of the network, the attacker could, in theory, maliciously rewrite the ledger for their own purposes.
Solving for this attack vector is one of the key design decisions in the Bitcoin protocol, as well as Ethereum, and others. In the case of Bitcoin, this was solved through the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, wherein the difficulty involved in mining new blocks effectively prevents any one actor from gaining this sort of control.

account
noun
An account, in web1 and web2 terms, refers to some sort of identity on some sort of digital platform. It is usually tied to an authentication method, e.g., username and password, which is granted, managed, and secured by the platform or service in question. By contrast, a web3 or crypto account consists of what is known as a public-private key pair; the public half is generally safe to be shared publicly, and in the case of Ethereum, is further processed to create what is known as the 'public address' of the account, always beginning with '0x'. The private half, meanwhile, gives total control over the account.
These public-private key pairs can be generated one at a time, or they can be <i>derived</i> from what is known as a <b>seed phrase</b> or <b>secret recovery phrase</b>; for more on this, see HD wallet.

attestation
noun
The process of verifying the authenticity or validity of a piece of information, or a transaction, on a distributed ledger.
While that may sound vague, that's because attestations are used in a broad range of contexts, and have both been crucial to the development of key blockchain network protocols – such as in Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms, in which validators *attest* to the validity of the transactions they're recording in blocks and syncing through the consensus protocol – or in more recent developments, wherein protocols like the Ethereum Attestation Service allow for the creation of custom attestation 'schemata', publicly accessible on a network. Individual 'attestations' can then be written according to the fields and structures defined in each individual schema, stored on-chain by users executing a call to the schema and signing it with a public key.

bitcoin
noun
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency or cryptocurrency, which was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public digital ledger called the blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers worldwide. Bitcoin transactions are made directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. Users can send and receive bitcoins using digital wallets. One of the key features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, which helps to prevent inflation and maintain the value of the currency. When referring to the overall network, capitalization is appropriate (Bitcoin), whereas when referring to the tokens themselves, lower-case is more appropriate (bitcoin). The plural of bitcoin is just bitcoin; the abbreviation is BTC, with a space: I have 250 BTC.
Bitcoin Core
Leading implementation of the software that enables users to interact with the Bitcoin network. Initially released by Satoshi.
bitcoin dominance

black swan event
noun phrase
metaphor
An event that is often entirely unexpected and deviates from the expected result causing widespread ramifications.
block
noun
A discrete, unique set of transactions sent on a public distributed ledger network, immutably recorded in a certain order.
Imagine a ledger that is being constantly synced between any number of exact copies of itself. People keep sending requests to add new entries to the ledger; these requests are transactions. When there are enough transactions ready, they get put into a specific order, and the *nodes*, each of which is keeping a copy of that ledger, reach consensus that the transactions are valid. Then, the transactions are cryptographically locked, in that order, into a 'block' and added forever to the ledger. This 'block' forms the starting point for the next one; in this way, they are all linked together in a chain, hence–blockchain.
block explorer

See also blockchain explorer.
block header
A section in a block containing metadata and a summary of the block's transactions. This is the information hashed when mining.

For example, Height 0 would be the very first block, which is also called the Genesis Block.
block reward
noun
The reward given to a miner or validator after it has successfully built a block of transactions and added them to the chain.
Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees. The composition depends on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 12.5 bitcoins per block.
block time
noun
The amount of time it takes for a block of transactions (see also: block) to be confirmed by the network.
See also 'Proof of Work', 'Proof of Stake'.
Blockaid
noun

blockchain
noun
A model used for structuring data in a database. Unlike other types of database structures, a blockchain inherently includes a record of the order and chronology of the data stored.
What is commonly referred to as a 'blockchain' might be more precisely called 'a public blockchain network', or a 'distributed ledger network'. While they get called 'blockchains' or 'chains', this is essentially a sort of metonymic usage. A public blockchain network consists, usually, of several different parts: 1. The blockchain or ledger itself. Think of this as the 'hard drive' of the network. 2. The consensus mechanism, and the consensus layer; this keeps all the copies of the ledger in sync, and adds new transactions or entries to it. 3. An execution layer: depending on the network in question, this layer or environment may vary from a very few functions built into the same software as the consensus client, to a very complex, Turing-complete, full-on Virtual Machine environment requiring those who run it to consider hardware requirements. There are, additionally, 'downstream' aspects of any one of these blockchain networks, including wallets, private-public key derivation logic, which programming languages can be used in interacting with it, etc. etc.
blockchain explorer
noun
A blockchain explorer, also known as a block explorer, is an application, most often a website along with a corresponding API, that displays information about blockchain activity in a more human-friendly way–like a phone book, or an atlas.
While a blockchain is designed to keep information forever, and be “readable by anyone”, finding the specific information you’re interested in may require indexing data off the blockchain–that is, sorting it according to given categories (sender address, token type, etc) into a separate database which can then be queried by the user; this essential function is provided by blockchain explorers. A prominent example is etherscan, which also offers explorers on a number of other networks.
blockchain trilemma
noun
The name given to the tradeoffs involved in three aspects of public blockchain network design: decentralization, security, and scalability (or speed). These three elements are either necessary or desireable in public distributed networks, and often, designing a system that optimizes for one compromises on another.

bounty
noun
A reward offered for exposing vulnerabilities and issues in computer code. For this reason, often referred to as a 'bug bounty'.
brain wallet
noun
A blockchain account generated from a seed phrase or password or passphrase made up by a human, as opposed to using a source of randomness to create it.
Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, or randomness, and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure; brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers. For this reason, brain wallet are insecure and should not be used. See also 'seed phrase'', 'Secret Recovery Phrase'.

bridge
noun, verb
A bridge is a tool built to move assets from one network to another. It’s also a verb, used to describe that action: 'I bridged my ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum'.
It would be fair to say both that the term 'bridge' is generally accurate, and that it does a lot of heavy lifting. The way that bridges are created, and maintained, varies from one to another, but often involve some sort of 'paired smart contracts', one on each network. These contracts would, e.g., lock, or burn, tokens on one chain, and either mint or somehow disburse an equivalent token, and amount of them, on the destination chain.
BscScan
BscScan is a blockchain explorer for BNB Smart Chain (BSC) users. It was developed by the same team behind the popular Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan.
BTC

BTC wallet address
A BTC wallet address is a unique string of letters and numbers used to send and receive Bitcoin transactions.
buidl
noun
Although coined (see what we did there) by the twitter hivemind, this term was popularized by Gitcoin's Kevin Owocki; it reflects the Ethereum-focused mindset of not just investing in a cryptocurrency as a store of value, but rather investing in it as an ecosystem and a platform for public goods and software; it complements, in this sense, the now-infamous HODL.
bull market
A positive trend in prices of a market. It is widely used not only in the cryptocurrency space but also in the traditional markets
burner wallet
noun phrase
web3

Byzantine fault tolerance
noun
A Byzantine fault, or failure, is one of the most difficult failures to deal with in computer systems; this is because it takes into account the possibility that the information used to determine the current state of the system may–or may not–be reliable. While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in public blockchain systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current state of the network when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the state of the network for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a network running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the network's ability to reach consensus on its current state. Therefore, a network that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant.
Byzantium fork
noun
A 'hard fork' in the Ethereum network that occurred in October of 2017. See also 'hard fork'.
candidate block
A temporary block created by a mining node (miner) to add to the blockchain to receive the block rewards.

centralized exchange
noun
A centralized exchange (CEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that is operated and controlled by a centralized entity. In a CEX, the exchange company or organization acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, holding and managing the assets on behalf of its users.
Centralized exchanges typically offer a wide range of trading pairs, with many popular cryptocurrencies available for trade. They also usually have high liquidity and offer advanced trading features such as margin trading, order types, and charting tools.
However, centralized exchanges also have several drawbacks. They are often targeted by hackers, as the centralized nature of the exchange makes them a single point of failure. They also require users to trust the exchange to hold their funds securely and execute trades fairly, which can be a source of concern for some users.
CEX
noun
Acronym; see 'Centralized Exchange'.
chain ID
noun
A chain ID is a unique identifier that represents a blockchain network, used to distinguish different blockchain networks from each other and to ensure that transactions and messages are sent to the correct network.
Ethereum networks have two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the same value, they have different uses. Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the network ID, while the transaction signature process uses the chain ID.

Codefi
noun
Derived from “Commerce & Decentralized Finance”, Codefi was a part of Consensys Software Inc., responsible for developing finance use case blockchain products; name no longer in use.
coin
noun
The term 'coin' has some nuances. Strictly speaking, a 'coin' could be defined as: A fungible token (all of them identical) issued on a blockchain, either as the network's transactional token, or through a smart contract deployed to that network. Some people may use 'coins' as shorthand for 'bitcoin'; the immortal aphorism 'not your keys, not your coins' refers to bitcoins. Another thing to keep in mind is that, while coins are put forward as some sort of representation of value, that value can vary wildly from one 'coin' to another. A coin may represent the value of the computational resources of the network, or it may be 'pegged' to represent fiat currency value, or it may float according to the value placed on immaterial resources like NFTs, membership, or digital goods, to name a few.
Coinbase Pay
noun
Coinbase Pay is a payment feature that allows you to buy or transfer supported crypto on Coinbase.com directly from self-custody wallets (like MetaMask) and dapps.
CoinGecko
noun
cold storage
noun
A phrasing borrowed from traditional data security; specifically in crypto, 'keeping assets in cold storage' refers to keeping the private keys that control them in a way that is never connected to the internet. This can refer to technological solutions like hardware wallets, as well as more low-tech methods, like writing down an SRP and keeping it in a safe.
See also: airgapping
cold wallet
noun
An offline wallet that is never connected to the internet. These are often referred to as 'airgapped' or 'cold storage' wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a 'hot' wallet, connected to the Internet, is 'ready to use on chain', and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.
collateral
Pledging something of value against a loan to guarantee that the person taking the loan will complete repayment.
colocation
A dedicated space in a data center belonging to stock exchanges which is shared with other entities such as high-frequency traders.
Not to be confused with 'collocation', referring to common placement of phrases or words together.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
US-based agency responsible for regulating derivatives, including options, swaps, and futures.
compile
verb
There are many languages in computing and software programming. In general, 'low-level' languages are those actually processed by the computer's operating system or processor, while 'high-level' languages are those typed in by software developers making programs. Compiling, then, is converting code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity) into a lower-level language (e.g., EVM bytecode).
Compound
noun
Compound is a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol that allows you to lend and borrow crypto — and have a say in its governance with its native COMP token.
compound interest
Compound interest refers to the interest accumulated on the principal amount, in addition to the interest from previous periods.
confirmation
noun
A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction, using whatever consensus mechanism it has in place.
Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.
confirmation time
The interval needed for a blockchain transaction to be approved and added to the ledger.
confluence
When multiple investment methods, technical indicators, or trading signals are combined to form a more reliable strategy.
Confluence is also the name of a workplace productivity tool, made by software company Atlassian.
consensus
noun
The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. This process is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus.
In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain, and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.
consensus algorithm
Consensus algorithms are mechanisms that help different computers in a blockchain network agree on what's true, even if some of them aren't playing fair.
consensus client
noun
A consensus client is software program, part of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network. It communicates with other nodes to reach consensus on the current state of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes have a consistent copy of the ledger. See also: 'consensus mechanism', 'client'.
consensus layer
noun
consensus mechanism
noun
Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) allow distributed systems (networks of computers) to work together and stay secure.
Consensys
noun
Short for Consensus Systems, fka ConsenSys. Launched alongside the founding of the Ethereum network by Joseph Lubin, Consensys was a sort of incubator, seeking to discover, nurture, and develop software, tooling, and use cases for programmable public blockchain networks. Consensys Mesh continues to serve in this broader 'incubator' role, while Consensys Software Inc. is a for-profit company, maintaining and producing the MetaMask wallet, the Infura and DeFura blockchain data access protocols, the Linea zkEVM Layer 2 network, and the Diligence smart contract auditing service, amongst many other products.

noun
One of the 'hard forks' made to the Ethereum network, in February 2019. See also 'hard fork'.
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
A Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure used to track the effects of inflation over a period of time.
contango and backwardation
Contango and backwardation are used to describe the relationship between the futures price of a commodity and its expected future spot price. They're useful metrics for trading and hedging.
contract
noun
See smart contract
contract account
noun
Generally, a contract account refers to the account that is associated with a smart contract; specifically, the public address at which the contract's methods can be called.
The interplay between accounts and contracts, as public blockchain technology has advanced, has resulted in a particularly dense semantic web. When a smart contract is deployed, the Externally Owned Account, or EOA (controlled by a human), which is used to pay the gas fees required to deploy the contract -- that is, write it to the blockchain and make it available in the first place -- is referred to as the 'contract deploying account'. The resulting smart contract itself has an account as well -- the public address which can be used to 'call', or access its methods -- that's the one we're calling, here, a 'contract account'. But don't worry, it gets significantly worse; at a certain point, new techniques began to be used, to 'abstract away' the difficulties involved in EOAs; this move towards 'account abstraction' resulted in the creation of end user-accessible, shall we say, accounts which are created and controlled by... Smart contracts (which, remember, have their own accounts). There was much soul-searching and hand-wringing in trying to figure out what to call these things; often, they are referred to as... *Smart Contract Accounts*, capitalized; that's SCA, for short.
CoolWallet
noun

credentials
Personal information. Examples include username, password, email address, qualifications and many more.
cross-chain bridge
Blockchain bridges connect different blockchain networks, enabling the movement of digital assets across networks and facilitating interoperability in the crypto space.
This phrasing, as used by Binance, is perhaps redundant. A bridge between blockchains is, by definition, cross-chain.
crypto-
noun
Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.
crypto-asset
noun
A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products.
crypto bounties
noun
As the entire decentralized web and crypto ecosystems rely heavily on funding mechanisms like venture capital, and a lot of the software being built is open source, there has traditionally been a large market for 'bounty-based' work, often paid in crypto.

crypto fund
noun
A crypto fund is a type of investment fund that focuses on investing in cryptocurrencies or companies involved in the cryptocurrency industry. These funds are designed to give investors exposure to the crypto market without the need for them to directly buy and hold cryptocurrencies themselves.
crypto protocol
A crypto protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern behavior in a decentralized network.
This phrasing, as used by Binance, is perhaps implying a differentiation where one does not exist. A protocol is a protocol, regardless of whether it is employed in a crypto context or otherwise.
crypto wallet
noun
A crypto wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions.
Crypto wallets come in different forms, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and paper wallets.

cryptography
noun
In its broadest sense, cryptography is the art of 'hidden writing' – using some sort of code to encrypt writing. In modern times, it often refers to the application of this concept within computing, communication, and data transfer through computers and computer networks.
Curve
noun
Curve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) to manage liquidity.
custody
noun
In the context of cryptocurrencies, custody refers to the safekeeping and management of digital assets on behalf of a client by a third-party service provider. Custody services are an important aspect of the cryptocurrency industry because cryptocurrencies are digital assets that require secure storage and management to prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized access.

Crypto custody services are typically offered by specialized companies that provide secure storage solutions for cryptocurrencies. These companies use various security measures such as multi-signature authentication, cold storage, and insurance to protect their clients' assets.

Decentralized Autonomous Cooperative (DAC)
An organization that is controlled by shareholders rather than a central authority.
Arguably, a DAO is, or often ends up being, simply 'an online cooperative with some smart contracts, maybe'.
Decentralized Autonomous Organization
noun
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO, pronounced like the Chinese concept) is a powerful and very flexible organizational structure built on a blockchain.
Alternatively, the first known example of a DAO is referred to as The DAO. The DAO served as a form of investor-directed venture capital fund, which sought to provide enterprises with new decentralized business models. Ethereum-based, The DAO’s code was open source. The organization set the record for the most crowdfunded project in 2016. Those funds were partially stolen by hackers. The hack caused an Ethereum hard-fork which lead to the creation of Ethereum Classic.
decentralized exchange
noun
A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies based on functionality programmed on the blockchain (i.e., in smart contracts). If cryptocurrency is web3’s monetary system, its financial system is DeFi.
This includes familiar concepts like loans and interest-bearing financial instruments, as well as so-called “DeFi primitives”, novel solutions like token swapping and liquidity pools. The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there are so-called on-ramp providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on deposit” the way a centralized exchange does. There are important technical and regulatory differences between these, which are constantly evolving.
decentralized finance
noun
Decentralized Indexes
A decentralized index is a type of investment vehicle that tracks the performance of multiple cryptocurrencies or digital assets traded on decentralized exchanges.
decentralized web
noun
The decentralized web, also known as web3, is a concept that refers to a new type of internet architecture that aims to provide a more open, secure, and privacy-preserving internet experience by removing the need for centralized intermediaries and giving users more control over their data.

In contrast to the current centralized web, where most online activities are controlled by a few large corporations and their servers, the decentralized web relies on a network of distributed nodes and peer-to-peer protocols to store and transmit data. This means that there is no central authority controlling the internet, and users can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries.
decryption
The act of reverting an encryption process so that unreadable data (ciphertext) can be converted into readable data (plaintext).
deep web
The part of the web that is somehow hidden, i.e., not indexed by Google and other traditional web sarch engines.
DeFi

noun
delisting
The removal of an asset from an exchange either as a request from the project team or as a decision made by the exchange.
denominations
noun
Cryptocurrencies are, generally speaking, broken into many more, and more granular, denominations than legacy currencies; that is to say, they have defined many decimal points past zero. There are a number of denominations of the currency we know as 'ether' or ETH; for the definitive explanation, see the original Ethereum Homestead documentation Ethereum Homestead documentation here.
depeg
Learn about causes, effects, and preventive measures to avoid a depeg and ensure stablecoin reliability and trust in the cryptocurrency market.
deposit
noun
In most web3 contexts, 'depositing' refers to the act of transferring some amount of token(s) to an address other than one's own, most often to a smart contract controlled by a 'protocol', such as a decentralized exchange, video game or multiverse, DAO, etc. Generally, the user will receive something in return for their deposit, and the deposit can be claimed at the user's discretion, or upon completion of given conditions. Compare with 'stake'.
depression
Understanding economic depression: Explore its causes, impacts, and how it might affect cryptocurrency markets in times of financial instability.
derive
noun
To derive something is to obtain it from an original source. In the context of crypto-technology, we often discuss 'deriving' wallets and accounts from seed phrases (aka Secret Recovery Phrases, or SRPs). This is literally true: the SRP represents a cryptographic key which is used to derive account addresses deterministically, meaning they will be derived the same way each time. Another, more technical, way of referring to this technology is to refer to 'hierarchical deterministic' wallets.
design flaw attack
Smart contract, decentralized market, or other software created with intentional flaws to trick users interacting with them

difficulty
noun
The concept outlining how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network during Proof of Work mining. In the Bitcoin network, the difficulty of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten minutes.
difficulty bomb
noun
The difficulty bomb, along with the Beacon Chain and others, was a key element of Ethereum's upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As the name indicates, the difficulty bomb was a software mechanism that increased block verification difficulty, making it more expensive and difficult–eventually, prohibitively so–to mine a new block. Through economic incentive, and later, the raw limitations of computing power, this forced the shift to PoS consensus. See also 'Proof of Stake', 'the Merge'.
digital asset
noun
A digital commodity that is scarce, electronically transferable, and intangible with a market value.
digital identity
noun
An online or networked identity adopted by an individual, organization, or electronic device.
digital signature
noun
A short string of data a user produces for a document using a private key such that anyone with the corresponding public key, the signature, and the document can verify that (1) the document was 'signed' by the owner of that particular private key, and (2) the document was not changed after it was signed.
Diligence
noun
direct market access (DMA)
Direct market access allows investors to place trades directly on exchanges, bypassing brokers for faster execution, more control, and lower fees.
Distributed Ledger Technology
noun
A type of database which spreads across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Records are stored sequentially in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned”, determining who can view it. This term is used, often, to refer in general to public blockchain technology, as ‘crypto’ has come to mean ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘web3’ is the collective community, and ‘blockchain’, after all, is “just” the data structure used to sync the distributed ledger itself.
divergence
When the market price of an asset and a technical indicator (e.g. RSI, Volume, MACD) are heading in opposite directions.
diversification
The allocation of funds across different types of assets and jurisdictions in order to reduce the overall risks.

double spend
noun
The 'double spend' is the benchmark security concern of blockchain networks: how do we ensure that someone doesn't send the same transaction to two different entities, essentially 'spending their money twice'? This is the cornerstone of the consensus mechanism, ensuring that all nodes of the network are 'in agreement' about which assets are allocated to which addresses, on an ongoing basis, to prevent malicious actions such as a double spend.
Eclipse Attack
When peers on the network are malicious and monopolize the network in order to prevent specific nodes from communicating.
ecosystem

EIP-1559
noun
Fundamentally, EIP-1559 gets rid of the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation. In first-price auctions, people bid a set amount of money to pay for their transaction to be processed, and the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, there will be a discrete “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. For users or applications that want to prioritize their transaction, they can add a “tip,” which is called a “priority fee” to pay a miner for faster inclusion.

Unravel elasticity, the measure of how one variable reacts to changes in another variable. Learn how elasticity is used in trading and everyday life.
encrypted key
noun
In MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.
encryption
noun
Encrpytion, literally 'in a hidden place', is the art and science of encoding information to control who can read it, or how it is to be read. Encryption occurs in natural (human) languages, as well as in machine and computer languages. Highly complex, and therefore difficult to decipher, encryption is an essential element enabling blockchain networks to be simultaneously public and secure.
endogenous variable

entropy
noun
In the context of cryptography, 'entropy' refers to 'randomness'; generally, the more random something is (the more entropy it has), the more secure it is.
epoch
noun
An epoch, in general, is a measure of time, or of blockchain progression, on a given blockchain. In Ethereum Proof of Stake, an epoch consists of 32 slots, each lasting 12 seconds, for a total of 6.4 minutes per epoch. There is additional functionality built upon the epoch measure in the Beacon Chain to help ensure security and proper operation of the Chain.
ERC
noun
Ethereum Request for Comment, or ERC, is a bit of a misnomer, as it is used to refer to suggestions for modifications that have already made it through the Ethereum Improvement Protocol (EIP) process and have been made standard on Ethereum. An ERC is, essentially, a set of standards for a given operation or topic on the Ethereum network. The authoritative list can be found here.
ERC-1155
noun
A token standard for creating semi-fungible tokens, meaning you can launch both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single smart contract.
ERC-20
noun
ERC is the abbreviation for Ethereum Request for Comment and is followed by the assignment number of the standard. ERC-20 is a technical standard for smart contracts which is used to issue the majority of tokens (in particular, cryptocurrency tokens) extant on Ethereum. This list of rules states the requirements that a token must fulfill to be compliant and function within the Ethereum network.
ERC-404
ERC-404 is a token standard blending fungibility and non-fungibility. Learn about its unique features, semi-fungible nature, mint-and-burn mechanism, and more.
ERC-721
noun
ERC-721 is a standard for Ethereum smart contracts, which allows for the issuance of a non-fungible token: this is the standard that created what we all now know as an NFT. This token standard is used to represent a unique digital asset that is not interchangeable, as opposed to the ERC-20 (or other equivalent) standard, which issues identical, interchangeable tokens.
ETF

Ethereum
noun
A public blockchain network and decentralized software platform upon which developers build and run applications. As it is a proper noun, it should always be capitalized.
Ethereum 2.0
noun
a.k.a The Merge

Finalized in September 2022, the Merge was the culmination of years of work involved in transitioning Ethereum from a Proof of Work consensus model, to Proof of Stake, all while keeping the network live. This was successful, and reduced the network’s carbon footprint by more than 99.9%.
Ethereum Classic
Ethereum Classic (ETC) emerged from the Ethereum hard fork that happened as a result of the 2016 DAO hack. Unlike ETH, ETC still uses Proof of Work.
Ethereum Foundation
Explore the Ethereum Foundation's role in blockchain evolution. From research to community support, discover how it shapes the future of decentralized technology.
Ethereum Improvement Proposal
noun
EIPs, as they are commonly known, are exactly that: Proposals made with the goal of improving some part of the Ethereum network.
There are many EIP-related entries in this glossary. EIPs are often highly technical in nature, dealing with difficult or obscure engineering problems. However, there is no rule in this regard; EIP-2228 established that Ethereum Mainnet should be capitalized. An EIP after our own heart. See also ERC.
Ethereum Mainnet
noun

Fantom
noun
Fantom is a public blockchain platform that aims to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions for dapps and smart contracts. It was launched in 2018 and is based on the Ethereum codebase, but with several key enhancements.

One of the main features of Fantom is its consensus mechanism, known as Lachesis, which is a variant of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that allows for high transaction throughput and low confirmation times. This means that transactions on the Fantom network can be processed quickly and at a low cost, making it an attractive platform for developers looking to build dApps that require fast and efficient transactions.
faucet
noun
A faucet is an application, sometimes a very simple website, other times more complex, that dispenses cryptocurrency. While some networks, especially those in early launch stages, offer “real Mainnet” tokens via faucets, it is much more common for a faucet to be present on a test network, or testnet. These faucets are used by developers to test out dapps or smart contracts before deploying them on Ethereum Mainnet, or users who want to practice an action on the blockchain with no risk. Tokens dispensed by a test faucet stay on the test networks and cannot be exchanged for mainnet equivalents.
fault-tolerant
adjective
Fault-tolerant refers to the ability of a software system to remain functional even if parts of it fail or malfunction.
Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)

Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)
A marketing strategy used to spread fear and insecurity among customers, traders, or investors.
fiat
Money that a government has declared to be legal tender.
While it is often referred to simply as 'fiat', the full phrase is 'fiat currency'. The word 'fiat' refers, in Latin, to 'trusting'; hence, a fiat currency is one that trusts in something else to provide it value. For example, we are trusting that a government will maintain the value of a currency, rather than it having some sort of inherent value, or value derived from the things for which it can be exchanged.
fiat currency
noun
Government-issued currency. For example, US Dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), Yuan (CNY), and Yen (JPY).
Fibonacci retracement
Fibonacci retracement is a popular technical analysis (TA) tool used by traders to identify potential support and resistance levels in financial markets.
fill or kill order (FOK)
A buy or sell order which must be executed immediately in its entirety or else it will be cancelled.
finality
noun
A transaction is considered 'final' once it can no longer be changed. In a sense, this happens once there are sufficient confirmations of the transaction, but for all intents and purposes, a transaction is final once the block that contains it is mined or validated. Keep in mind that this reflects a fundamental rule of blockchains: unlike traditional financial systems where charges can be 'reversed', there is no 'undoing' a transaction on the blockchain. Once finality is reached, the transaction is immutable.
finality rate
noun
See 'finality'
financial technology
noun
finney
noun
A denomination of ether. See ether (denomination).

fork
noun
Forking' is a term that comes from the world of collaborative software development, and refers to the action of copying an existing application or set of code and modifying it to create an alternate version. At the blockchain protocol level, a 'fork' creates an alternative version of a blockchain. Forks are often enacted intentionally to apply upgrades to a network. Soft Forks render two chains with some compatibility, while Hard Forks create a new version of the chain that must be adopted to continue participation. In the instance of a contentious Hard Fork, this can create two versions of a blockchain network. See also 'hard fork'.

fraud proof
noun
A security model for certain layer 2 solutions where, to increase speed, transactions are rolled up into batches and submitted to Ethereum in a single transaction. They are assumed valid but can be challenged if fraud is suspected. A fraud proof will then run the transaction to see if fraud took place. This method increases the amount of transactions possible while maintaining security.

FTM
noun
full node
noun
Public blockchains consist of a network of computers which sync the network's data, coordinate transaction requests, and participate in consensus regarding the validity of those transactions; each one of these computers is called a 'node'. A full node is a computer that can fully validate transactions and download the entire data of a specific blockchain. In contrast, a “lightweight” or “light” node does not download all pieces of a blockchain’s data, and uses a different validation process.

Gas fee refers to the transaction fee on the blockchain. It is what users pay to get their transaction validated, or completed.
gas limit
noun
The gas limit is the maximum amount you’re willing to pay for any given transaction to go through the Ethereum network. Another way of looking at it is as a “rough estimate” of how much computing power your transaction will take.
gas price
noun
The gas price is what it sounds like: the cost the network is paid for the computational work being performed in a given transaction. It is paid in units of ETH called gwei. Depending on network congestion, the gas price may vary significantly.
Gas Station Network
noun
The Gas Station Network (GSN) is a decentralized network of relayers mainly referring to the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to build dapps which provide payment for transactions, so users do not need to hold Ether or ETH to pay for gas, easing their onboarding process and improving user acquisition and experience.
However, while the relayers in the GSN do not charge users, they charge the recipient and contract instead. In this way, the relayers recover the costs of transactions and profit from extra fees for providing such services.
Originally conceived and designed by TabooKey, the GSN has grown to encompass many companies, protocols and platforms in the Ethereum ecosystem that wish to facilitate the onboarding of users to Ethereum applications. Gas Station Network

hash
noun
In computing, ‘hashing’ is an operation performed on lists or sets of data to create a reliable index for that data. A particular datum, or a reference to it, is fed into an algorithm, which transforms the datum and returns a standardized, and generally unrecognizable, ‘hash’ of it, sometimes referred to as that datum or file’s “digital fingerprint.” Each block in a blockchain contains the hash value that validated the block before it, followed by its own hash value (this is how the continuity of the ‘chain’ is constructed). Hashes can be used to confirm that blockchain transactions are complete and valid. You may see references to the “transaction hash” or “tx hash”; this should be understood as “unique identifier of the transaction”.

layer 0
noun
Layer 0 in blockchain refers to the underlying infrastructure that supports the blockchain network. It includes the physical hardware, such as computers, servers, and other network components, as well as the software protocols that govern the interactions between the nodes in the network.

In other words, Layer 0 is the foundation upon which the blockchain network is built. It provides the necessary resources and technical capabilities for the network to function, such as computing power, storage, and network connectivity. Layer 0 is essential to the operation and security of the blockchain network, as it ensures that data is transmitted and stored correctly and securely across the network.

Layer 0 is sometimes also referred to as 'Layer Zero' or 'L0'. It is important to note that the concept of Layer 0 is not unique to blockchain technology, but is a more general term used to describe the physical and technical infrastructure underlying any type of computer network.
layer 1
noun
Layer 1 in blockchain refers to the base layer of the blockchain protocol. It is the layer that contains the core elements of the blockchain, including the consensus mechanism, the data structure, and the rules that govern the creation and transfer of assets or tokens.

In other words, Layer 1 is the foundation of the blockchain technology stack, upon which all other layers and applications are built. It is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network and ensuring that all transactions are valid and secure.

Layer 1 is designed to be decentralized, meaning that no single entity has control over the network. This is achieved through the use of consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or other methods, which enable participants to reach agreement on the validity of transactions and the state of the network.

Some examples of Layer 1 blockchain protocols include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche.
layer 2
noun
A Layer 2 network, or L2, is a blockchain that is built specifically to scale another network. For a full understanding of how this is achieved, see here. Some popular examples of this in the Ethereum ecosystem are Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet. These chains are specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on Ethereum Mainnet for security functions, while optimizing for speed and scale. These networks are considered 'scaling solutions' while not being part of Ethereum's protocol-level scaling efforts. See also 'blockchain trilemma', 'modular blockchain', 'Serenity'. Contrast with 'sidechain'.

light client
noun
In computing, a 'client' is a software that runs or accesses a program made available by a remote computer. With blockchain networks, then, clients are the programs that sync blockchain data and participate in network consensus. More often and more specifically, 'Layer 2' is used as a noun, to refer to a type of network that is specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on Ethereum mainnet for security functions, and optimizing for speed and scale. Examples include Arbitrum and Optimism; this is different from a 'sidechain', which is a network that has its own security mechanism, yet still allows compatibility and bridging of assets between itself and Ethereum.
Lightning Network
noun

liquidity staking
noun
Liquid staking allows users to stake tokens and simultaneously use them in the DeFi ecosystem. This is made possible by wrapping the staked tokens and providing users with a wrapped token that is a claim on the underlying collateral. The wrapped tokens can be transferred and generate yield.
Liquid staking permits users to stake and unstake their coins without being beholden to a lock-up period. It thus enables greater capital efficiency and increased liquidity on proof-of-stake blockchains, allowing users to maximize the benefits of staking and DeFi simultaneously. Furthermore, liquid staking enhances network security on PoS chains.

noun
abbreviation; Memory Pool. Also commonly referred to as a 'transaction pool'. When a user submits a transaction to the Ethereum network–or many other networks based on Ethereum–the transaction goes into what’s known as a “transaction pool”, or “txpool” for short. This is essentially a queue of transactions that are waiting to be added to a block and recorded to the blockchain. There are mechanisms that determine which transactions are “picked up” and included in the next block, and there is currently a lot of research surrounding how this decision gets made. In Bitcoin, the transaction pool was referred to as the “memory pool”, or “mempool”, and often these terms are used interchangeably.

noun
Bitcoin is an example of a monolithic blockchain: all of the functions of the network (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) are run on one chain. This has significant drawbacks (see 'blockchain trilemma' for more). A modular blockchain, on the other hand, separates some or all of these functions into separate chains, each one optimized for its specific function, and relying on the other chains for the other functions. Ethereum is currently moving towards modularization, both on a protocol level beginning with the Merge, which split consensus and execution into two chains, and at the level of 'Layer 2' networks which provide optimized execution environments, and then 'roll up' their data to Ethereum for its consensus functionality.

multi-sig
noun
multi-signature wallet (multisig)
A crypto-asset wallet which requires multiple keys in order to access and transact. Typically, a specified number of individuals are required to approve or “sign” a transaction before they are able to access the wallet. This is different from most wallets, which only require one signature to approve a transaction. In the crypto industry, 'multi-sig' is used commonly as a shortened version of the full phrase 'multi-signature wallet.'

NFT
noun
When discussing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), “fungibility” refers to an object’s ability to be exchanged for another. For example, an individual dollar is considered fungible, as one dollar is fully interchangeable with another. Artwork is usually deemed non-fungible, as paintings or sculptures are likely to be unequal between them in quality, value, or other attributes. A non-fungible token is a type of token that is a unique digital asset and has no equal token. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like ether that are fungible in nature.
NFT aggregator
noun
In the initial wave of interest in buying and selling NFTs, a number of NFT marketplaces–websites where you can buy and sell NFTs–were created. As the market matured, aggregators appeared, which offer the user the ability to view available stock and price, buy and sell across marketplaces from a single unified application. Similar to familiar web2 shopping portals, these have come to be known as NFT Marketplace Aggregators, or just NFT Aggregators.
NFT drop
noun
An NFT drop happens when a new NFT collection is released. NFT drops can vary in both how the NFTs are sold (listed for sale or auction), and in who they’re released to (the public, or a specific list called an “allowlist”).

A full node is a computer that can fully validate transactions and download the entire data of a specific blockchain. In contrast, a “lightweight” or “light” node does not download all pieces of a blockchain’s data, and uses a different validation process.
non-fungible token
noun
See NFT
nonce
noun
The word ‘nonce’ has a few different meanings, and in different contexts, it ends up getting used a lot of different ways. Originally formed from a contraction of a phrase meaning “not more than once”, on the Ethereum Mainnet, “nonce” refers to a unique transaction identification number that increases in value with each successive transaction in order to ensure various safety features (such as preventing a double-spend). Note that due to its broader use in cryptography, you may encounter ‘nonce’ being used differently on other sidechains or decentralized projects.

off-chain
adjective phrase
A transaction that is processed outside the blockchain network with an increased speed and reduced cost. There are two different transactions that occur on the blockchain:
On-chain transactions are those reflected on the distributed ledger and are visible to all the network users. On the other hand, off-chain transactions occur outside the blockchain network. Such a transaction doesn’t need the services of miners because no ledger verification is conducted.
Unlike on-chain transactions, off-chain transactions can be made instantly. This method entails lower fees, happens instantly, and offers more anonymity.
off-ramp
noun

ommer block
noun
Under the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, miners received rewards for being the first to mine a new block. However, at times a block would be mined just after, and in competition with, the last block. This block, known as an ommer and previously as an uncle, could get rolled into subsequent blocks and the miner of the original ommer would get a partial block reward. All of this functionality was deprecated as of the launch of the Beacon Chain.
on-chain
adjective
On-chain, as the name implies, refers to blockchain transactions that exist on and have been verified to the blockchain by miners or validators. On-Chain also means that transactions have been recorded to the blockchain

Optimism
noun
Optimism is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, which s://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/on-chainis a blockchain-based platform for decentralized applications. It is designed to reduce the cost and increase the speed of transactions on the Ethereum network. Optimism works by using a technique called optimistic rollups, which allows it to process a large number of transactions off-chain, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

In optimistic rollups, transactions are initially processed off-chain, and a summary of these transactions is then submitted to the Ethereum network for verification. This verification process ensures that the transactions are valid and that no fraud has occurred. Once the transactions are verified, they are added to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to interact with the decentralized applications built on the platform.
optimistic rollup
noun
A rollup that assumes the validity and good faith of transactions, and only runs a fraud proof in the case of fraud being alleged. See also 'rollup'.

permission
noun
permissioned ledger
noun
A blockchain network in which access to ledger or network requires permission from an individual or group of individuals, as opposed to a public blockchain. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. Consensus on a permissioned ledger is conducted by the trusted actors, such as government departments, banks, or other known entities. Permissioned blockchains or ledgers contain highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is much easier to maintain and considerably faster than a public blockchain. For example, Quorum or Hyperledger Besu are permissioned ledgers that can be more easily set up for large enterprises. In contrast, the public Ethereum blockchain is a permissionless ledger which anyone can access.
permissionless blockchain
Permissionless blockchains are open networks that allow anyone to participate in the consensus process without the need to obtain approval, permission, or authorization.

PoS
noun
Initialism; Proof of Stake. A consensus mechanism in which an individual node, or “validator”, validates transactions or blocks. Validators lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency, such as ether, into a ‘stake’, in order to be able to participate in consensus. If the node validates a block (group of transactions) correctly, then the validator receives a reward. Conversely, if the validator behaves poorly by validating incorrect transactions or by not maintaining sufficient network connectivity, the cryptocurrency they staked can be ‘slashed’, or taken from them and put out of circulation (‘burned’). PoS requires a negligible amount of computing power compared to Proof of Work consensus.
PoW
noun
Initialism; Proof of Work.A consensus mechanism in which each block is ‘mined’ by one of the nodes, or a group of nodes, on the network. The computational process involved in committing a series of transactions into a block on the network, known as ‘hashing a block’, is technically quite simple, and therefore subject to attack. Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network.

For each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency. PoW is singificantly more energy-intensive than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake.

priority fee
noun
The priority fee, also referred to as the 'miner tip', incentivizes the miner to prioritize your transaction.

Naturally, whether this does actually go to a miner depends on the consensus mechanism they use: Ethereum mainnet became a Proof of Stake network following the Merge in September 2022, so the priority fee goes to validators instead of miners.
Prisoner's Dilemma

Proof of Stake
noun
A consensus mechanism in which an individual node, or “validator”, validates transactions or blocks. Validators lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency, such as ether, into a ‘stake’, in order to be able to participate in consensus. If the node validates a block (group of transactions) correctly, then the validator receives a reward. Conversely, if the validator behaves poorly by validating incorrect transactions or by not maintaining sufficient network connectivity, the cryptocurrency they staked can be ‘slashed’, or taken from them and put out of circulation (‘burned’). PoS requires a negligible amount of computing power compared to Proof of Work consensus.
Proof of Staked Authority
Proof of Staked Authority merges Proof of Stake and Proof of Authority, enhancing blockchain security through its equal staking and balanced validation system
Proof of Work
noun
A consensus mechanism in which each block is ‘mined’ by one of the nodes, or a group of nodes, on the network. The computational process involved in committing a series of transactions into a block on the network, known as ‘hashing a block’, is technically quite simple, and therefore subject to attack. Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition.

public address
noun
An Ethereum public address, also known as an Ethereum account address, is a string of 42 characters (including letters and numbers) that is used to receive or send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens on the Ethereum network.

Each Ethereum public address is unique and is associated with a private key that allows the owner of the address to sign and authorize transactions. The public address is derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm, and it can be shared with others to receive payments or tokens.

When sending Ethereum or tokens, users need to specify the recipient's public address as the destination for the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the Ethereum or tokens are transferred to the recipient's address.
public blockchain
noun
A globally open network wherein anyone can participate in transactions, participate in the consensus protocol to help determine which blocks get added to the chain, maintain and examine the contents of the chain.
public key
noun
Public blockchain networks are just that: public. Their data is accessible and readable by anyone. In order to have any degree of usability when it comes to allowing users to do some things, like send transactions, but not others, like steal other peoples’ tokens, cryptographic technology is used. In particular, a design paradigm known as ‘public/private key pairs’ is employed to ensure users can interact with others on the network as they wish, while keeping their own account secure.

These key pairs consist of two long strings of alphanumeric characters. A public key can be derived mathematically from its corresponding private key, but the inverse is not true: it is mathematically impossible to derive a private key from its corresponding public key. This allows, for example, users to have a public wallet address that anyone can use to send them tokens, with the peace of mind that as long as they properly keep the corresponding private key safe, those tokens cannot be stolen. See also ‘private key’.

Secret Recovery Phrase
noun
The seed phrase, mnemonic, or Secret Recovery Phrase is a crucial part of public blockchain technology, originally created for Bitcoin, and goes by many names. However, they all refer to a set of ordered words which correspond to determined values. These values never change, and therefore the same string of words in the same order will always produce the same number–this is the underlying functionality that allows seed phrases to back up wallets. This is also where the name ‘hierarchical deterministic wallets’ comes from, as all the accounts in a given wallet are deterministically created from the seed phrase, and they are hierarchically controlled by it.
A Secret Recovery Phrase is exactly what it sounds like: something that is secret, and should be known only to the owner of the account. If the seed phrase is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the account; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc. What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your crypto wallet secure

The plan that outlined these changes was originally referred to as 'Serenity', although that name has become less popular, in favor of specific descriptions of the upgrades themselves.
serialization
noun
The process of converting a data structure into a sequence of bytes. Ethereum internally uses an encoding format called recursive-length prefix encoding (RLP).
shard chain
noun
A proof-of-stake chain that is coordinated by the Beacon Chain and secured by validators. There will be 64 added to the network as part of the shard chain upgrade. Shard chains will offer increased transaction throughput for Ethereum by providing additional data to layer 2 solutions like optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups.
sharding
verb
Sharding, in public blockchains, refers to splitting an entire network into multiple portions, called “shards.” Each shard would contain its own independent state, meaning a unique set of account balances and smart contracts. Sharding is currently being investigated and developed as one of the set of tools and solutions for scaling Ethereum.

shielded transaction
noun
A shielded transaction is essentially a transaction that is between two shielded addresses.
sidechain
noun
A ‘sidechain’ refers to a chain that is connected to another (most often, to Ethereum) through a bridge, allowing assets to be transferred between them. In contrast to a Layer 2 network or a rollup, a sidechain is a full blockchain network in and of itself, and does not rely on Ethereum for consensus. It therefore must be evaluated independently in terms of its security, stability, and other features. See also “blockchain trilemma”, “modular blockchain”.

Note: Bridges exist for good reason; sending tokens from a sidechain to Ethereum mainnet or vice versa would result in token loss.
signature
noun
In the context of public blockchain networks, a 'signature' is generally a cryptographic signature, generated by a public-private key pair. See 'Digital signature'

smart contract
noun
Smart contracts are programs that have been published on a public blockchain, and can be used by anyone. While they often contain agreements or sets of actions between parties that emulate a traditional legal contract, they are not, in and of themselves, legal documents.

soft fork
noun
A change to the blockchain protocol resulting in only previously valid blocks and transactions being made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. However, this can result in a potential divide in the blockchain, as the old software generates blocks that read as invalid according to the new rules. Contrast with 'hard fork'; for more basic information regarding forks, see 'fork'.

stagflation
Stagflation is an economic challenge that includes slow economic growth, higher scarcity of job offerings, and inflation (rising prices of goods and services).
stake
verb
Staking is the act of depositing ETH to activate new validators on the Ethereum protocol. Validators help keep Ethereum secure and operational by validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain.
staking
verb
On the Ethereum Proof of Stake network, those wishing to participate in consensus must first lock up, or ‘stake’, 32 ETH into a smart contract; this ETH may be ‘slashed’ (taken from them and ‘burned’, put out of circulation) in the event that their validator behaves maliciously or does not meet performance requirements. Similar Proof of Stake mechanisms are in operation on other networks, as well.

Although this is the canonical meaning of the word, similar actions taken at the level of a decentralized exchange (DEX) or another dapp are often called ‘staking’, though it would probably be more accurate and descriptive to just call this ‘locking up tokens’.
Staking Pool
A pool where stakeholders combine their staking power to increase their chance of successfully validating a new block.
state
noun
The set of data that a blockchain network strictly needs to keep track of, and that represents data currently relevant to applications on the chain.

When a user submits a transaction to the Ethereum network–or many other networks based on Ethereum–the transaction goes into what's know as a 'transaction pool', or 'txpool' for short. This is essentially a queue of transactions that are waiting to be added to a block and recorded to the blockchain. There are mechanisms that determine which transactions are 'picked up' and included in the next block, and there is currently a lot of research surrounding how this decision gets made (see 'MEV'). In Bitcoin, the transaction pool was referred to as the 'memory pool', or 'mempool', and often these terms are used interchangeably.

trustless
adjective
Trustless' is a term that gets used a lot in the decentralized web, and it deserves some explanation. Traditionally, to call something 'trustless' would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a centralized entity that 'must be trusted' as the source of truth. With public blockchain networks, data isn't kept on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. This is why the term 'trustless' was coined: there is no need for trust, although, in a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust between people, because the system is guaranteed to work the same for everyone.
Turing-complete
adjective
Any machine that can calculate on a level equal to a programmable computer is Turing-complete, or computationally universal. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which processes smart contracts and transactions, is Turing-complete, despite not existing on a single physical computer.
TVL
noun
Initialism; Total Value Locked, or TVL, is a common expression used in many contexts across the crypto ecosystem, so it's important to pay attention to the specifics. In general, it refers to how much value, in tokens, has been deposited into something. Most often, it refers to a protocol, which is an application on the blockchain, or a set of protocols. For example, a decentralized token trading platform might have a series of liquidity pools, which are protocols enabling swaps between tokens, and the platform may quote the 'TVL' for all the pools combined. Alternatively, if a network uses proof of stake for their consensus mechanism, they may represent the TVL of all the tokens staked into that consensus protocol.
TXID
noun
Initialism; Transaction ID. Usually a long 'hash' string of characters identifying a particular blockchain transaction, e.g. on a blockchain explorer.

unencrypted key
noun
In an Ethereum wallet application like MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.

UTXOs use public key cryptography to identify and transfer ownership between holders of public/private key pairs. UTXOs are formatted with the recipient's public key, thus restricting the ability to spend that UTXO to the account that can prove ownership of the associated private key. The UTXO can only be spent if it includes the digital signature associated with the public key attached the last time it was sent.

verb
Unstaking is the act of withdrawing ETH from a staking platform, which allows a user to move and transact with it freely.

A block or slot that has reached maximum lockout on a validator. The root is the highest block that is an ancestor of all active forks on a validator. All ancestor blocks of a root are also transitively a root. Blocks that are not an ancestor and not a descendant of the root are excluded from consideration for consensus and can be discarded.
runtime
The component of a validator responsible for program execution.
Sealevel
Solana's parallel run-time for onchain programs.
shred
A fraction of a block; the smallest unit sent between validators.
skip rate
The percentage of skipped slots out of the total leader slots in the current epoch. This metric can be misleading as it has high variance after the epoch boundary when the sample size is small, as well as for validators with a low number of leader slots, however can also be useful in identifying node misconfigurations at times.
skipped slot
A past slot that did not produce a block, because the leader was offline or the fork containing the slot was abandoned for a better alternative by cluster consensus. A skipped slot will not appear as an ancestor for blocks at subsequent slots, nor increment the block height, nor expire the oldest recent_blockhash. Whether a slot has been skipped can only be determined when it becomes older than the latest rooted (thus not-skipped) slot.
SOL
The native token of a Solana cluster.
Solana Program Library (SPL)
A library of programs on Solana such as spl-token that facilitates tasks such as creating and using tokens.

The number of confirmed blocks since the transaction was accepted onto the ledger. A transaction is finalized when its block becomes a root.
transactions entry
A set of transactions that may be executed in parallel.
TVU
Transaction validation unit.
VDF
See verifiable delay function.
verifiable delay function
A function that takes a fixed amount of time to execute that produces a proof that it ran, which can then be verified in less time than it took to produce.
vote
See ledger vote.
vote credit
A reward tally for validators. A vote credit is awarded to a validator in its vote account when the validator reaches a root.
warmup period
Some number of epochs after stake has been delegated while it progressively becomes effective. During this period, the stake is considered to be "activating". More info about: warmup and cooldown

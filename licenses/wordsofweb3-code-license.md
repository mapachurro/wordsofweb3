## wordsofweb3 licenses overview
wordsofweb3, from a licensing perspective, is made up of three parts:

1. The code used to build, run, and manage the backend assets of the site

2. The actual "content", meaning the terms, their proununciations, their definitions, categorizations, and any other fields which may be added to the homepages or term pages of each entry in the future

3. The Education DAO logo, identity, and brand, including its graphic assets and color scheme, as used in association with the Education DAO identity. The usage of these is copyrighted by Education DAO, with all rights reserved.

## The wordsofweb3 code license

The *code* of wordsofweb3--meaning both everything that ends up in the built version of the site, as well as all code in the repo that is used to import terms, maintain the lists of terms, their definitions, etc., that is not covered by other superceding licenses (e.g. the Bootstrap licenses)--is released under the Don't Be A Dick License.

With apologies for the mild vulgarity of the license, Education DAO appreciates the emphasis that is placed on attribution and doing the right thing, while allowing for permissionless development; both of these features seem in line with our values.

> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

	 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.  
	 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a [bug report](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html).

 4. If you use code, calling it your own would make you a ROYAL dick. [How to cite a repo](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository). Alternatively, even just a comment giving attribution to where you found the code would be OK.

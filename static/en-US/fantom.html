    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Fantom is a public <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> platform that aims to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions for dapps and smart contracts. It was launched in 2018 and is based on the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> codebase, but with several key enhancements. One of the main features of Fantom is its consensus mechanism, known as Lachesis, which is a variant of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that allows for high transaction throughput and low confirmation times. This means that transactions on the Fantom network can be processed quickly and at a low cost, making it an attractive platform for developers looking to build dApps that require fast and efficient transactions.</p>

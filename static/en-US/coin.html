    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> The term 'coin' has some nuances. Strictly speaking, a 'coin' could be defined as: A fungible token (all of them identical) issued on a <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>, either as the network's transactional token, or through a <a href="./smart-contract.html">smart contract</a> deployed to that network. Some people may use 'coins' as shorthand for '<a href="./bitcoin.html">bitcoin</a>'; the immortal aphorism 'not your keys, not your coins' refers to bitcoins. Another thing to keep in mind is that, while coins are put forward as some sort of representation of value, that value can vary wildly from one 'coin' to another. A coin may represent the value of the computational resources of the network, or it may be 'pegged' to represent <a href="./fiat-currency.html">fiat currency</a> value, or it may float according to the value placed on immaterial resources like NFTs, membership, or digital goods, to name a few.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Fantom is a public blockchain platform that aims to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions for dapps and smart contracts. It was launched in 2018 and is based on the Ethereum codebase, but with several key enhancements. One of the main features of Fantom is its consensus mechanism, known as Lachesis, which is a variant of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that allows for high transaction throughput and low confirmation times. This means that transactions on the Fantom network can be processed quickly and at a low cost, making it an attractive platform for developers looking to build dApps that require fast and efficient transactions.</p>

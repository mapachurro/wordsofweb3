    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Initialism; Total Value Locked, or TVL, is a common expression used in many contexts across the crypto ecosystem, so it's important to pay attention to the specifics. In general, it refers to how much value, in tokens, has been deposited into something. Most often, it refers to a protocol, which is an application on the blockchain, or a set of protocols. For example, a decentralized token trading platform might have a series of liquidity pools, which are protocols enabling swaps between tokens, and the platform may quote the 'TVL' for all the pools combined. Alternatively, if a network uses proof of stake for their consensus mechanism, they may represent the TVL of all the tokens staked into that consensus protocol.</p>

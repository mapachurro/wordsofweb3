    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Layer 1 in blockchain refers to the base layer of the blockchain protocol. It is the layer that contains the core elements of the blockchain, including the consensus mechanism, the data structure, and the rules that govern the creation and transfer of assets or tokens. In other words, Layer 1 is the foundation of the blockchain technology stack, upon which all other layers and applications are built. It is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network and ensuring that all transactions are valid and secure. Layer 1 is designed to be decentralized, meaning that no single entity has control over the network. This is achieved through the use of consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or other methods, which enable participants to reach agreement on the validity of transactions and the state of the network. Some examples of Layer 1 blockchain protocols include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche.</p>

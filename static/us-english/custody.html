    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> In the context of cryptocurrencies, custody refers to the safekeeping and management of digital assets on behalf of a client by a third-party service provider. Custody services are an important aspect of the cryptocurrency industry because cryptocurrencies are digital assets that require secure storage and management to prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized access. Crypto custody services are typically offered by specialized companies that provide secure storage solutions for cryptocurrencies. These companies use various security measures such as multi-signature authentication, cold storage, and insurance to protect their clients' assets.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> To derive something is to obtain it from an original source. In the context of crypto-technology, we often discuss 'deriving' wallets and accounts from seed phrases (aka Secret Recovery Phrases, or SRPs). This is literally true: the SRP represents a cryptographic key which is used to derive account addresses deterministically, meaning they will be derived the same way each time. Another, more technical, way of referring to this technology is to refer to 'hierarchical deterministic' wallets.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Layer 0 in blockchain refers to the underlying infrastructure that supports the blockchain network. It includes the physical hardware, such as computers, servers, and other network components, as well as the software protocols that govern the interactions between the nodes in the network. In other words, Layer 0 is the foundation upon which the blockchain network is built. It provides the necessary resources and technical capabilities for the network to function, such as computing power, storage, and network connectivity. Layer 0 is essential to the operation and security of the blockchain network, as it ensures that data is transmitted and stored correctly and securely across the network. Layer 0 is sometimes also referred to as 'Layer Zero' or 'L0'. It is important to note that the concept of Layer 0 is not unique to blockchain technology, but is a more general term used to describe the physical and technical infrastructure underlying any type of computer network.</p>

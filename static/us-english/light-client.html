With <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> networks, then, clients are the programs that sync <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> data and participate in <a href="./network.html">network</a> <a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a>. More often and more specifically, '<a href="./layer-2.html">Layer 2</a>' is used as a noun, to refer to a type of <a href="./network.html">network</a> that is specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> <a href="./mainnet.html">mainnet</a> for security functions, and optimizing for speed and scale. Examples include <a href="./arbitrum.html">Arbitrum</a> and <a href="./optimism.html">Optimism</a>; this is different from a '<a href="./sidechain.html">sidechain</a>', which is a <a href="./network.html">network</a> that has its own security mechanism, yet still allows compatibility and bridging of assets between itself and <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a>.</p>

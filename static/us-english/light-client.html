    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> In computing, a 'client' is a software that runs or accesses a program made available by a remote computer. With blockchain networks, then, clients are the programs that sync blockchain data and participate in network consensus. More often and more specifically, 'Layer 2' is used as a noun, to refer to a type of network that is specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on Ethereum mainnet for security functions, and optimizing for speed and scale. Examples include Arbitrum and Optimism; this is different from a 'sidechain', which is a network that has its own security mechanism, yet still allows compatibility and bridging of assets between itself and Ethereum.</p>

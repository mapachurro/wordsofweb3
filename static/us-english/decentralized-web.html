    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> The decentralized web, also known as <a href="./web3.html">web3</a>, is a concept that refers to a new type of internet architecture that aims to provide a more open, secure, and privacy-preserving internet experience by removing the need for centralized intermediaries and giving users more control over their data. In contrast to the current centralized web, where most online activities are controlled by a few large corporations and their servers, the decentralized web relies on a <a href="./network.html">network</a> of distributed nodes and peer-to-peer protocols to store and transmit data. This means that there is no central authority controlling the internet, and users can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries.</p>

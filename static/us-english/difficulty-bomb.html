    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> The difficulty bomb, along with the Beacon Chain and others, was a key element of Ethereum's upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As the name indicates, the difficulty bomb was a software mechanism that increased block verification difficulty, making it more expensive and difficult--eventually, prohibitively so--to mine a new block. Through economic incentive, and later, the raw limitations of computing power, this forced the shift to PoS consensus. See also 'Proof of Stake', 'the Merge'.</p>

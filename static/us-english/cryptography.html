    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> In its broadest sense, cryptography is the art of 'hidden writing' -- using some sort of code to encrypt writing. In modern times, it often refers to the application of this concept within computing, communication, and data transfer through computers and computer networks. Cryptography has been protected as free speech in the United States, and provides the technological foundation that allows blockchain networks to be public: despite the ledger being open and accessible by all, control over the state of the ledger and the ability to move assets on it is mediated through cryptographic tools, such as the Secret Recovery Phrase.</p>

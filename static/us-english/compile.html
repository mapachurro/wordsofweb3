    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> There are many languages in computing and software programming. In general, 'low-level' languages are those actually processed by the computer's operating system or processor, while 'high-level' languages are those typed in by software developers making programs. Compiling, then, is converting code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity) into a lower-level language (e.g., EVM bytecode).</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Formally speaking, a 'protocol' is a set of rules governing how a process is carried out. This concept is used throughout public blockchain networks and web3 to refer to the way smart contracts execute their functionality in the same way regardless of the user. The products or services built on top of smart contracts are often referred to as 'protocols' by extension.</p>

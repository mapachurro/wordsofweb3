    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Rollups (pronounced 'roll ups') are one element in the set of tools and infrastructure being built as scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They consist, in general, of networks which prioritize their ability to compute transactions and smart contract functionality, and then 'roll up' those transactions to Ethereum Mainnet for secure verification of their validity. There are different ways of approaching this problem from a technical point of view, namely Zero Knowledge, or ZK, rollups, and Optimistic rollups. Arbitrum and Optimism are prominent examples. See the entries on both of these types of rollup for more, and more in-depth discussion here.</p>

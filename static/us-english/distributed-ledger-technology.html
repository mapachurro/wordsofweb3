    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A type of database which spreads across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Records are stored sequentially in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned”, determining who can view it. This term is used, often, to refer in general to public blockchain technology, as ‘crypto’ has come to mean ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘web3’ is the collective community, and ‘blockchain’, after all, is “just” the data structure used to sync the distributed ledger itself.</p>

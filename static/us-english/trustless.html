    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Trustless' is a term that gets used a lot in the <a href="./decentralized-web.html">decentralized web</a>, and it deserves some explanation. Traditionally, to call something 'trustless' would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the <a href="./ledger.html">ledger</a> of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a centralized entity that 'must be trusted' as the source of truth. With <a href="./public-<a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>.html">public <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a></a> networks, data isn't kept on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. This is why the term 'trustless' was coined: there is no need for trust, although, in a way, the rules and assurances built into the <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> provide the basis for greater trust between people, because the system is guaranteed to work the same for everyone.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> An Ethereum public address, also known as an Ethereum account address, is a string of 42 characters (including letters and numbers) that is used to receive or send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens on the Ethereum network. Each Ethereum public address is unique and is associated with a private key that allows the owner of the address to sign and authorize transactions. The public address is derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm, and it can be shared with others to receive payments or tokens. When sending Ethereum or tokens, users need to specify the recipient's public address as the destination for the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the Ethereum or tokens are transferred to the recipient's address.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A token lock-up refers to a mechanism where certain tokens or cryptocurrency holdings are locked up or frozen for a specified period of time to restrict their transfer or sale. This is often used in the context of initial coin offerings (ICOs), where token issuers may require investors to commit to holding onto their tokens for a certain period, typically to ensure that investors are committed to the project's long-term success. Token lock-up periods can vary in duration and can be predetermined or set according to certain conditions, such as reaching a certain milestone, liquidity event or network upgrade. During the lock-up period, the tokens cannot be transferred or sold, although in some cases, they may be staked or used to participate in certain network activities. Once the lock-up period is over, the tokens can be freely traded or sold.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> An offline wallet that is never connected to the internet. These are often referred to as "airgapped" or "cold storage" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a "hot" wallet, connected to the Internet, is "ready to use on chain", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.</p>

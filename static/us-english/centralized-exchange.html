    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A centralized exchange (CEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that is operated and controlled by a centralized entity. In a CEX, the exchange company or organization acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, holding and managing the assets on behalf of its users. Centralized exchanges typically offer a wide range of trading pairs, with many popular cryptocurrencies available for trade. They also usually have high liquidity and offer advanced trading features such as margin trading, order types, and charting tools. However, centralized exchanges also have several drawbacks. They are often targeted by hackers, as the centralized nature of the exchange makes them a single point of failure. They also require users to trust the exchange to hold their funds securely and execute trades fairly, which can be a source of concern for some users.</p>

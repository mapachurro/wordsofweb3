    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> In computing, ‘hashing’ is an operation performed on lists or sets of data to create a reliable index for that data. A particular datum, or a reference to it, is fed into an algorithm, which transforms the datum and returns a standardized, and generally unrecognizable, ‘hash’ of it, sometimes referred to as that datum or file’s “digital fingerprint.” Each block in a blockchain contains the hash value that validated the block before it, followed by its own hash value (this is how the continuity of the ‘chain’ is constructed). Hashes can be used to confirm that blockchain transactions are complete and valid. You may see references to the “transaction hash” or “tx hash”; this should be understood as “unique identifier of the transaction”.</p>

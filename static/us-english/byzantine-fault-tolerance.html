    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A Byzantine fault, or failure, is one of the most difficult failures to deal with in computer systems; this is because it takes into account the possibility that the information used to determine the current state of the system may--or may not--be reliable. While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in public blockchain systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current state of the network when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the state of the network for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a network running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the network's ability to reach consensus on its current state. Therefore, a network that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant.</p>

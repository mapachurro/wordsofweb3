    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A Byzantine fault, or failure, is one of the most difficult failures to deal with in computer systems; this is because it takes into <a href="./account.html">account</a> the possibility that the information used to determine the current <a href="./state.html">state</a> of the system may--or may not--be reliable. While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in <a href="./public-<a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>.html">public <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a></a> systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current <a href="./state.html">state</a> of the <a href="./network.html">network</a> when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the <a href="./state.html">state</a> of the <a href="./network.html">network</a> for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a <a href="./network.html">network</a> running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the <a href="./network.html">network</a>'s ability to reach <a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a> on its current <a href="./state.html">state</a>. Therefore, a <a href="./network.html">network</a> that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Optimism is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, which is a blockchain-based platform for decentralized applications. It is designed to reduce the cost and increase the speed of transactions on the Ethereum network. Optimism works by using a technique called optimistic rollups, which allows it to process a large number of transactions off-chain, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. In optimistic rollups, transactions are initially processed off-chain, and a summary of these transactions is then submitted to the Ethereum network for verification. This verification process ensures that the transactions are valid and that no fraud has occurred. Once the transactions are verified, they are added to the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to interact with the decentralized applications built on the platform.</p>

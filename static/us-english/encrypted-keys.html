    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> As discussed elsewhere, public and private cryptographic key pairs are one of the technologies that underpins cryptocurrencies and 'crypto' tech in general. In <a href="./metamask.html">MetaMask</a>, an unencrypted <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> that has gone through the process of <a href="./encryption.html">encryption</a>. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s <a href="./wallet.html">wallet</a> information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a>, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> from it by reversing the method of <a href="./encryption.html">encryption</a>.</p>

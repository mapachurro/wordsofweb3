    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.</p>

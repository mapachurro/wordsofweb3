    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Bitcoin is an example of a monolithic blockchain: all of the functions of the network (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) are run on one chain. This has significant drawbacks (see 'blockchain trilemma' for more). A modular blockchain, on the other hand, separates some or all of these functions into separate chains, each one optimized for its specific function, and relying on the other chains for the other functions. Ethereum is currently moving towards modularization, both on a protocol level beginning with the Merge, which split consensus and execution into two chains, and at the level of 'Layer 2' networks which provide optimized execution environments, and then 'roll up' their data to Ethereum for its consensus functionality.</p>

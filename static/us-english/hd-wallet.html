    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Initialism; Hierarchical Deterministic wallets were first created for Bitcoin, and enable the creation of a very large number of accounts based on an initial seed phrase. This technology was later adopted in Ethereum wallets; when restoring a MetaMask wallet from the Secret Recovery Phrase, for example, if you 'create' accounts, they will be the same accounts as previously created from that same phrase; they are derived from it.</p>

    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> If we think of a blockchain as consisting of a ledger that is being constantly synced between any number of different nodes (indeed, 'distributed ledger technology' is another phrase used to describe it), imagine that after a certain number of transactions have been added to the ledger and consensus has been reached among the nodes that the transactions are valid, then they are cryptographically locked into a 'block' and officially recorded; this 'block' forms the basis for the next one; in this way, they are all linked together in a chain, hence--blockchain.</p>

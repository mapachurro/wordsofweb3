If the <a href="./seed-phrase.html">seed phrase</a> is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the <a href="./account.html">account</a>; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc.    What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your <a href="./<a href="./crypto-.html">crypto-</a><a href="./wallet.html">wallet</a>.html">crypto <a href="./wallet.html">wallet</a></a> secure</p>

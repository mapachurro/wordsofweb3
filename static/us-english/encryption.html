    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Encrpytion, literally 'in a hidden place', is the art and science of encoding information to control who can read it, or how it is to be read. Encryption occurs in natural (human) languages, as well as in machine and computer languages. Highly complex, and therefore difficult to decipher, encryption is an essential element enabling blockchain networks to be simultaneously public and secure.</p>

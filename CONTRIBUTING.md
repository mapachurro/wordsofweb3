### Submitting Changes

## Internationalization

### Language Support
- Each term should be available in multiple languages
- Maintain consistent structure across translations
- Consider cultural context and regional variations

### Translation Process
1. **Term Selection**
   - Identify terms needing translation
   - Verify technical accuracy
   - Consider regional variations

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - Cultural context validation

3. **Documentation**

- ENS name resolution: Verify ENS names and records

### Data Validation

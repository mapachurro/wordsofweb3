51% attack,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈfɪfti wʌn pərˈsɛnt əˈtæk/,"If more than half the computer power or mining hash rate on a network is run by a single person or a single group of people, then a 51% attack is in operation. This means that this entity has full control of the network and can negatively affect a cryptocurrency by taking over mining operations, stopping or changing transactions, and double-spending coins."
account,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/əˈkaʊnt/,"Accounts are records or statements of financial expenditure and receipts that relate to a particular period or purpose. In the world of crypto, this is referred to as a cryptocurrency account. It gives you certain benefits, and it is a requirement in order to use just about any cryptocurrency exchange. A cryptocurrency account gives you access to hot wallets, which allow you to quickly buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies, and it gives you an identity or a way through which you can hold onto your public keys when it comes to the aforementioned process."
address,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈæd.rɛs/ ""ˈpʌblɪk ˈæd.rɛs""","Synonymous with ""public address"", ""wallet address"". Used to send and receive transactions on a blockchain network, and to identify different users; also referred to as a 'public key'. An address is an alphanumeric character string, which can also be represented as a scannable QR code. In Ethereum, the address begins with 0x.

aggregator,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈæɡrɪˌɡeɪtər/,An aggregator is a platform that aggregates liquidity from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other sources of liquidity to provide users with the best prices and the most efficient execution for their trades.
air-gapping,verb,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈɛrˌɡæpɪŋ/,"A method for securing computers in which the device does not connect to the internet or any other open networks. Many hardware wallets use air-gapping as a security mechanism to keep users' private keys or Secret Recovery Phrase offline, and thus safer from any kind of attack."
airdrop,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈɛrˌdrɑp/,"A token distribution method used to send cryptocurrency or tokens to wallet addresses. Sometimes airdrops are used for marketing purposes in exchange for simple tasks like reshares, referrals, or app downloads."
altcoin,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈɔltˌkɔɪn/,"As Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, the term 'altcoin' was created to refer to 'any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin'. The term is less used in Ethereum or smart contract-enabled blockchain communities. Many altcoins are forks of Bitcoin with minor changes (e.g., Litecoin). See also 'fork'."
appchain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈæpˌtʃeɪn/,"A blockchain network custom-made and optimized for a specific application's needs. An appchain is generally not a full-blown blockchain, but offers an optimized execution environment for the application, while still relying on an underlying blockchain for consensus. See also: 'blockchain trilemma', 'modular blockchain', 'Layer 2', 'Layer 3'."
asset provenance,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈæsɛt ˈprɑvənəns/,"Asset provenance refers to the origin, history, and ownership of a particular digital asset on the blockchain. In the crypto context, asset provenance refers to the ability to trace the ownership and transfer of a specific cryptocurrency or token from its creation or minting to its current holder."
attestation,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌætɪˈsteɪʃən/,"Attestation in crypto refers to the process of verifying the authenticity or validity of a piece of information or a transaction on a blockchain network. Attestation is an important aspect of blockchain technology, as it helps to ensure the integrity and security of the network. In general, attestation involves a trusted third-party, or attester, verifying the authenticity of a transaction or piece of information. This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts. For more info, see Attestation in Ethereum."
base fee,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈbeɪs fiː/,Every block has a reserve price known as the 'base fee'. It is the minimum gas fee a user must pay to include a transaction in the next block.
block,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/blɑk/,"If we think of a blockchain as consisting of a ledger that is being constantly synced between any number of different nodes (indeed, 'distributed ledger technology' is another phrase used to describe it), imagine that after a certain number of transactions have been added to the ledger and consensus has been reached among the nodes that the transactions are valid, then they are cryptographically locked into a 'block' and officially recorded; this 'block' forms the basis for the next one; in this way, they are all linked together in a chain, hence--blockchain."
block explorer,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/blɑk ɪkˈsplɔrər/,"A blockchain explorer is an application, most often a website along with a corresponding API, that displays information about blockchain activity in a more human-friendly way. While a blockchain is designed to keep information forever, and be “readable by anyone”, finding the specific information you’re interested in may require indexing data off the blockchain–that is, sorting it according to given categories (sender address, token type, etc) into a separate database which can then be queried by the user; this essential function is provided by blockchain explorers. A prominent example is etherscan, which also offers explorers on a number of other networks."
block height,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/blɑk haɪt/,"The number of blocks connected together in the blockchain. For example, Height 0 would be the very first block, which is also called the Genesis Block."
block reward,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/blɑk rɪˈwɔrd/,"The reward given to a miner or validator after it has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees. The composition depends on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 12.5 bitcoins per block."
block time,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/blɑk taɪm/,"When we talk about 'block time', we're referring to how long it takes for a block of transactions (see 'block') to be confirmed by the network, either by miners under PoW or by validators under PoS. See also 'Proof of Work', 'Proof of Stake'."
blockchain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈblɑkˌtʃeɪn/,"A digital ledger comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. Each block is ‘chained’ to the next block using a cryptographic signature. Ethereum is a public blockchain, open to the world; its digital ledger is distributed, or synced, between many nodes; these nodes arrive at consensus regarding whether a transaction is valid before encrypting it, along with a number of other valid transactions, into a block. For more on blockchain technology, see here. See also 'block'."
blockchain explorer,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈblɑkˌtʃeɪn ɪkˈsplɔrər/,"A blockchain explorer is an application, most often a website along with a corresponding API, that displays information about blockchain activity in a more human-friendly way.

A prominent example is etherscan, which also offers explorers on a number of other networks."
blockchain trilemma,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈblɑkˌtʃeɪn traɪˈlɛmə/,"Tradeoffs facing those building public blockchain networks vis-a-vis three elements: decentralization, security, and scalability (or speed). These three elements are either necessary or desireable in public distributed networks, and often, designing a system that optimizes for one compromises on another."
brain wallet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/breɪn ˈwɔlɪt/,"A blockchain account generated from a seed phrase or password or passphrase of your choosing. Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, or randomness, and therefore the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure; brain wallets can be brute forced by super fast computers. For this reason, brain wallet are insecure and should not be used. See also 'Seed phrase / Secret Recovery Phrase'."
bridge,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/brɪdʒ/,"A bridge is a tool built to move assets from one network to another. It’s also a verb, used to describe that action: “I bridged my ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum.” Not all bridges are created equal, and you should be informed about what you’re doing before you use one.  Field Guide to bridges   See also MetaMask Bridge"
buidl,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈbɪdl/,"Ostensibly coined (see what we did there) by Gitcoin's Kevin Owocki. It reflects the Ethereum-focused mindset of not just investing in a cryptocurrency as a store of value, but rather investing in it as an ecosystem and a platform for public goods and software; it complements, in this sense, the now-infamous HODL."
Byzantium fork,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/bɪˈzæn.ti.əm fɔːrk/,"A 'hard fork' in the Ethereum network that occurred in October of 2017. For detailled information, see here; see also 'hard fork'."
centralized exchange,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˌsɛntrəˈlaɪzd ɪkˈstʃeɪndʒ/, /ˈsiːˈɛks/","A centralized exchange (CEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange that is operated and controlled by a centralized entity. In a CEX, the exchange company or organization acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, holding and managing the assets on behalf of its users. Centralized exchanges typically offer a wide range of trading pairs, with many popular cryptocurrencies available for trade. They also usually have high liquidity and offer advanced trading features such as margin trading, order types, and charting tools. However, centralized exchanges also have several drawbacks. They are often targeted by hackers, as the centralized nature of the exchange makes them a single point of failure. They also require users to trust the exchange to hold their funds securely and execute trades fairly, which can be a source of concern for some users."
CEX,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsiːˈɛks/,Acronym; see 'Centralized Exchange'.
chain ID,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/tʃeɪn ˈaɪˈdiː/,"A chain ID is a unique identifier that represents a blockchain network. We use it to distinguish different blockchain networks from each other and to ensure that transactions and messages are sent to the correct network. Ethereum networks have two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the same value, they have different uses. Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the network ID, while the transaction signature process uses the chain ID."
client,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈklaɪənt/, /ɪˈθiːriəm ɔːr ˈʌðər kəmˈpætəbl ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/","In computing in general, a 'client' is a program, running on a local computer, that is accessing data made available by a remote computer. In public blockchain networks, a 'client' is the software that actually does the work of syncing block data, confirming transactions, participating in network consensus, and running any virtual machine or logic processes, if applicable. A client usually includes a cryptocurrency software wallet."
coin,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/kɔɪn/,"The term 'coin' has some nuances. Strictly speaking, a 'coin' could be defined as: A fungible token (all of them identical) issued on a blockchain, either as the network's transactional token, or through a smart contract deployed to that network. Some people may use 'coins' as shorthand for 'bitcoin'; the immortal aphorism 'not your keys, not your coins' refers to bitcoins. Another thing to keep in mind is that, while coins are put forward as some sort of representation of value, that value can vary wildly from one 'coin' to another. A coin may represent the value of the computational resources of the network, or it may be 'pegged' to represent fiat currency value, or it may float according to the value placed on immaterial resources like NFTs, membership, or digital goods, to name a few."
cold storage,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/koʊld ˈstɔrɪdʒ/,"cold wallet/cold storage: An offline wallet that is never connected to the internet. These wallets protect cryptocurrencies from getting hacked online. For more information, check out MetaMask's Hardware Wallet Hub: Hardware Wallet Hub"
cold wallet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/koʊld ˈwɔlɪt/ /koʊld ˈstɔrɪdʒ/,"An offline wallet that is never connected to the internet. These are often referred to as ""airgapped"" or ""cold storage"" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a ""hot"" wallet, connected to the Internet, is ""ready to use on chain"", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens."
confirmation,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack."
consensus,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/kənˈsɛnsəs/,"The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain."
consensus client,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈklaɪənt/,"A consensus client is a component of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network. It communicates with other nodes to reach consensus on the current state of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes have a consistent copy of the ledger. See also: ""consensus mechanism""."
consensus mechanism,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈleɪər/,Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) allow distributed systems (networks of computers) to work together and stay secure.

crypto asset,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ ˈæsɛt/,"A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products."
crypto bounties,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ ˈbaʊntiz/,"Crypto bounties are an important rewards mechanism that blockchain projects utilize in order to secure the successful accomplishments of certain tasks required by the network. Initially, bounties were intended as a marketing tool to attract users to participate in performing validation services for blockchain projects. Today, crypto bounties have developed significantly beyond the purpose of a simple marketing tool. crypto bounties"
crypto fund,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ fʌnd/,A crypto fund is a type of investment fund that focuses on investing in cryptocurrencies or companies involved in the cryptocurrency industry. These funds are designed to give investors exposure to the crypto market without the need for them to directly buy and hold cryptocurrencies themselves.
crypto wallet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ ˈwɔlɪt/,"A crypto wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. Crypto wallets come in different forms, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and paper wallets."
crypto-,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-/,"Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms."
crypto-compliance,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-kəmˈplaɪəns/,A blanket term used to refer to ensuring crypto projects conform with applicable regulations and laws.
cryptoassets,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkrɪptoʊˌæsɛts/,"A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products."
cryptocurrency,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌkrɪptəˈkɜrənsi/,"Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank, and are kept track of through distributed ledger technology."
cryptoeconomics,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌkrɪptoʊɪˈkɒnəmɪks/,"The economic analysis of decentralized finance; notably, the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab."
cryptography,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/krɪpˈtɒɡrəfi/,"In its broadest sense, cryptography is the art of 'hidden writing' -- using some sort of code to encrypt writing. In modern times, it often refers to the application of this concept within computing, communication, and data transfer through computers and computer networks. Cryptography has been protected as free speech in the United States, and provides the technological foundation that allows blockchain networks to be public: despite the ledger being open and accessible by all, control over the state of the ledger and the ability to move assets on it is mediated through cryptographic tools, such as the Secret Recovery Phrase."
DAO,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/daʊ/,Acronym; see 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization'.
dapp,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/dæp/,Acronym; see 'decentralized application'
decentralization,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlɪˈzeɪʃən/,"The transfer of authority and responsibility from a centralized organization, government, or party to a distributed network."
decentralized application,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlaɪzd ˌæplɪˈkeɪʃən/,"An open-source software application with backend (not user-facing) code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, rather than a centralized server. You may see alternate spellings: dApps, DApps, Dapps, and Đapps."
Decentralized Autonomous Organization,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˌdiːsɛntrəlaɪzd ɔːˈtɒnəməs ˌɔrɡənaɪˈzeɪʃən/, /daʊ/","A Digital Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO, pronounced like the Chinese concept) is a powerful and very flexible organizational structure built on a blockchain. Alternatively, the first known example of a DAO is referred to as The DAO. The DAO served as a form of investor-directed venture capital fund, which sought to provide enterprises with new decentralized business models. Ethereum-based, The DAO’s code was open source. The organization set the record for the most crowdfunded project in 2016. Those funds were partially stolen by hackers. The hack caused an Ethereum hard-fork which lead to the creation of Ethereum Classic."
decentralized exchange,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˌdiːsɛntrəˈlaɪzd ɪkˈstʃeɪndʒ/, /ˈdɛks/","A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies based on functionality programmed on the blockchain (i.e., in smart contracts). If cryptocurrency is web3’s monetary system, its financial system is DeFi. This includes familiar concepts like loans and interest-bearing financial instruments, as well as so-called “DeFi primitives”, novel solutions like token swapping and liquidity pools. The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there are so-called on-ramp providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on deposit” the way a centralized exchange does. There are important technical and regulatory differences between these, which are constantly evolving."
decentralized web,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌdiːsɛntrəˈlaɪzd wɛb/,"The decentralized web, also known as web3, is a concept that refers to a new type of internet architecture that aims to provide a more open, secure, and privacy-preserving internet experience by removing the need for centralized intermediaries and giving users more control over their data.  In contrast to the current centralized web, where most online activities are controlled by a few large corporations and their servers, the decentralized web relies on a network of distributed nodes and peer-to-peer protocols to store and transmit data. This means that there is no central authority controlling the internet, and users can interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries."

Delegated proof of stake (DPoS),noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/dɪˈlɛɡeɪtɪd pruːf əv steɪk/, /ˌdiːˌpiːˈoʊˈɛs/",
denominations,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈiːθər/ /ˈdɛnəmɪˌneɪʃənz/,"Cryptocurrencies are, generally speaking, broken into many more, and more granular, denominations than legacy currencies; that is to say, they have defined many decimal points past zero. There are a number of denominations of the currency we know as 'ether' or ETH; for the definitive explanation, see the original Ethereum Homestead documentation Ethereum Homestead documentation here."
derive / derivation,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/dɪˈraɪv/, /dɪˈrɪveɪʃən/","To derive something is to obtain it from an original source. In the context of crypto-technology, we often discuss 'deriving' wallets and accounts from seed phrases (aka Secret Recovery Phrases, or SRPs). This is literally true: the SRP represents a cryptographic key which is used to derive account addresses deterministically, meaning they will be derived the same way each time. Another, more technical, way of referring to this technology is to refer to 'hierarchical deterministic' wallets."
DEX,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈdɛks/,Acronym; see 'decentralized exchange'.
difficulty,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈdɪfɪkəlti/,"The concept outlining how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network during Proof of Work mining. In the Bitcoin network, the difficulty of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten minutes."
difficulty bomb,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈdɪfɪkəlti bɒm/,"The difficulty bomb, along with the Beacon Chain and others, was a key element of Ethereum's upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 and a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. As the name indicates, the difficulty bomb was a software mechanism that increased block verification difficulty, making it more expensive and difficult--eventually, prohibitively so--to mine a new block. Through economic incentive, and later, the raw limitations of computing power, this forced the shift to PoS consensus. See also 'Proof of Stake', 'the Merge'."
digital identity,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈdɪdʒɪtəl aɪˈdɛntɪti/,"An online or networked identity adopted by an individual, organization, or electronic device."

distributed ledger,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/dɪˈstrɪbjʊtɪd ˈlɛdʒər/,"A type of database which spreads across multiple sites, countries, or institutions. Records are stored sequentially in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned”, determining who can view it. This term is used, often, to refer in general to public blockchain technology, as 'crypto' has come to mean 'cryptocurrency', 'web3' is the collective community, and 'blockchain', after all, is 'just' the data structure used to sync the distributed ledger itself."
Distributed Ledger Technology,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/dɪˈstrɪbjʊtɪd ˈlɛdʒər tɛkˈnɒlədʒi/,"A type of database which spreads across multiple sites, countries, or institutions.

Individual EIPs are referred to by the name assigned to them in the repository, for example, EIP-1559. EIP-1559 will change Ethereum’s fee market mechanism. Fundamentally, EIP-1559 gets rid of the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation. In first-price auctions, people bid a set amount of money to pay for their transaction to be processed, and the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, there will be a discrete “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. For users or applications that want to prioritize their transaction, they can add a “tip,” which is called a “priority fee” to pay a miner for faster inclusion."
encrypted keys,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɛnˈkrɪptɪd vs ʌnˈɛnkrɪptɪd kiːz/,"As discussed elsewhere, public and private cryptographic key pairs are one of the technologies that underpins cryptocurrencies and 'crypto' tech in general. In MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption."

execution client,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɪɡˈzɛkʃən ˈklaɪənt/,"Execution clients are tasked with processing and broadcasting transactions, as well as with managing Ethereum's state. They run the computations for each transaction in the Ethereum Virtual Machine to ensure that the rules of the protocol are followed. Today, they also handle proof of work consensus. After the transition to proof of stake, they will delegate this to consensus clients."
execution layer,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɪɡˈzɛkʃən ˈleɪər/,Ethereum's execution layer is the network of execution clients.
Extended Private Key,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ɪkˈstɛndɪd ˈpraɪvɪt kiː/, /ˈɛksˌpraɪv/","See 'private key' often seen as the acronym 'XPRV'; see 'Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)' wallet.

While some networks, especially those in early launch stages, offer “real Mainnet” tokens via faucets, it is much more common for a faucet to be present on a test network, or testnet. These faucets are used by developers to test out dapps or smart contracts before deploying them on Ethereum Mainnet, or users who want to practice an action on the blockchain with no risk. Tokens dispensed by a test faucet stay on the test networks and cannot be exchanged for mainnet equivalents."
finality,adjective,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈfaɪnəl/, /faɪˈnælɪti/","A transaction is considered 'final' once it can no longer be changed. In a sense, this happens once there are sufficient confirmations of the transaction, but for all intents and purposes, a transaction is final once the block that contains it is mined or validated. Keep in mind that this reflects a fundamental rule of blockchains: unlike traditional financial systems where charges can be 'reversed', there is no 'undoing' a transaction on the blockchain. Once finality is reached, the transaction is immutable."

This method increases the amount of transactions possible while maintaining security."
full node,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/fʊl noʊd/,"Public blockchains consist of a network of computers which sync the network's data, coordinate transaction requests, and participate in consensus regarding the validity of those transactions; each one of these computers is called a 'node'. A full node is a computer that can fully validate transactions and download the entire data of a specific blockchain. In contrast, a “lightweight” or “light” node does not download all pieces of a blockchain’s data, and uses a different validation process."
gas,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɡæs/,"A measure of the computational steps required for a transaction on the Ethereum network. This then equates to a fee for network users paid in small units of ETH specified as gwei. For more on gas, see MetaMask’s user guide here:  User Guide: Gas"

hardware wallet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈhɑrdwɛər ˈwɔlɪt/,"A hardware wallet is a physical device that is used to store cryptographic keys, and generally, sign transactions. Some hardware wallets can be connected physically or through software to internet connectivity; others are ‘air-gapped’, receiving transaction requests and sending transaction approvals through a mechanism such as a QR code. The overall goal of using a hardware wallet to manage keys and signatures is to reduce the likelihood of your keys or Secret Recovery Phrase from being somehow stolen or compromised, due to being connected to the Internet. For more on hardware wallets, see MetaMask’s Hardware Wallet Hub: Hardware Wallet Hub"
hash,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/hæʃ/,"In computing, ‘hashing’ is an operation performed on lists or sets of data to create a reliable index for that data. A particular datum, or a reference to it, is fed into an algorithm, which transforms the datum and returns a standardized, and generally unrecognizable, ‘hash’ of it, sometimes referred to as that datum or file’s “digital fingerprint.” Each block in a blockchain contains the hash value that validated the block before it, followed by its own hash value (this is how the continuity of the ‘chain’ is constructed). Hashes can be used to confirm that blockchain transactions are complete and valid. You may see references to the “transaction hash” or “tx hash”; this should be understood as “unique identifier of the transaction”."
HD wallet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌhaɪəˈrɑrkɪkəl dɪˈtɜrmɪnɪstɪk ˈwɔlɪt/,"Initialism; Hierarchical Deterministic wallets were first created for Bitcoin, and enable the creation of a very large number of accounts based on an initial seed phrase.

Hyperledger,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈhaɪpərˌlɛdʒər/,"Hyperledger is an ecosystem of open-system tools, libraries, and products designed to enable and support enterprise-grade blockchain technology. In general, the products focus on creating solutions for permissioned blockchains--that is, non-public blockchains, with alternative consensus mechanisms other than Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). That said, there are use cases where such institutions would want to integrate with public blockchains, and for that reason Hyperledger Besu and Hyperledger Burrow are actively developed projects, the former being a Java-based Ethereum client, the latter being a smart contract platform which supports EVM bytecode."
ICO,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈaɪkoʊ/,"An Initial Coin Offering (also called ICO) occurs when a new token project sells advance tokens in exchange for upfront capital. These have been a vehicle for fraud and scams, and as such are subject to ever-evolving regulation and legislation."

internal transaction,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈɪntərnəl ˌtrænˈzækʃən/,"An internal transaction on the Ethereum network is one that occurs between smart contracts, rather than between addresses. Notably, they are not included on the blockchain, and therefore do not incur gas fees, but they are often crucial to carrying out the action in question, and can be viewed on Etherscan. For more detail, see MetaMask's article on the topic: Internal Transactions"
interoperability,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌɪntərɒpəˈræbɪlɪti/,"Blockchain interoperability, or cross-chain interoperability, is the ability to see and share information across multiple blockchains. One of the clear benefits of blockchain interoperability is being able to trade assets across various blockchains without the need for a centralized, custodial exchange. Interoperability"
Kovan,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈkoʊvən/,"An Ethereum testnet that uses Proof of Authority consensus, available through MetaMask; Kovan test network has been deprecated. Ethereum used to have four testnets: Ropsten, Rinkeby, Goerli, and Kovan (Kiln was also added for specific purposes relating to the Merge in 2022). However, after the Merge occurred on September 15th 2022, most of the existing testnets began being deprecated (taken out of service). They may still work, but could be unreliable. Sepolia and Goerli are now the only two available."
Layer 0,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈleɪər ˈzɪroʊ/,"Layer 0 in blockchain refers to the underlying infrastructure that supports the blockchain network. It includes the physical hardware, such as computers, servers, and other network components, as well as the software protocols that govern the interactions between the nodes in the network.  In other words, Layer 0 is the foundation upon which the blockchain network is built. It provides the necessary resources and technical capabilities for the network to function, such as computing power, storage, and network connectivity. Layer 0 is essential to the operation and security of the blockchain network, as it ensures that data is transmitted and stored correctly and securely across the network.  Layer 0 is sometimes also referred to as 'Layer Zero' or 'L0'. It is important to note that the concept of Layer 0 is not unique to blockchain technology, but is a more general term used to describe the physical and technical infrastructure underlying any type of computer network."
Layer 1,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈleɪər ˈwʌn/,"Layer 1 in blockchain refers to the base layer of the blockchain protocol. It is the layer that contains the core elements of the blockchain, including the consensus mechanism, the data structure, and the rules that govern the creation and transfer of assets or tokens.  In other words, Layer 1 is the foundation of the blockchain technology stack, upon which all other layers and applications are built. It is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the blockchain network and ensuring that all transactions are valid and secure.  Layer 1 is designed to be decentralized, meaning that no single entity has control over the network. This is achieved through the use of consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or other methods, which enable participants to reach agreement on the validity of transactions and the state of the network.  Some examples of Layer 1 blockchain protocols include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche."
Layer 2,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈleɪər ˈtuː/,"A Layer 2 network, or L2, is a blockchain that is built specifically to scale another network. For a full understanding of how this is achieved, see here. Some popular examples of this in the Ethereum ecosystem are Arbitrum, Optimism, and StarkNet. These chains are specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on Ethereum Mainnet for security functions, while optimizing for speed and scale. These networks are considered 'scaling solutions' while not being part of Ethereum's protocol-level scaling efforts. See also 'blockchain trilemma', 'modular blockchain', 'Serenity'. Contrast with 'sidechain'."
Liquid Democracy (Delegative Democracy),noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈlɪkwɪd dɪˈmɒkrəsi/ (/ˈdɛlɪɡətɪv dɪˈmɒkrəsi/),"A government system where votes can be delegated or proxied to other individuals such as friends, politicians, or subject matter experts. For example, in a liquid democracy, Bernadette could give Ahmad her vote and Ahmad would then vote for both himself and Bernadette. Liquid democracy is used at times as a governance mechanism for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) wherein every participant is able to vote or delegate their vote to another individual."
liquidity pool,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/lɪˈkwɪdɪti puːl/,"A liquidity pool is a crowdsourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked in a smart contract that is used to facilitate trades between the assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Instead of traditional markets of buyers and sellers, many decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms use automated market makers (AMMs), which allow digital assets to be traded in an automatic and permissionless manner through the use of liquidity pools."
liquidity staking,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/lɪˈkwɪdɪti ˈsteɪkɪŋ/,"Liquid staking allows users to stake tokens and simultaneously use them in the DeFi ecosystem. This is made possible by wrapping the staked tokens and providing users with a wrapped token that is a claim on the underlying collateral. The wrapped tokens can be transferred and generate yield. Liquid staking permits users to stake and unstake their coins without being beholden to a lock-up period. It thus enables greater capital efficiency and increased liquidity on proof-of-stake blockchains, allowing users to maximize the benefits of staking and DeFi simultaneously. Furthermore, liquid staking enhances network security on PoS chains."

mempool,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmɛmpuːl/,"abbreviation; Memory Pool. Also commonly referred to as a 'transaction pool'.  When a user submits a transaction to the Ethereum network–or many other networks based on Ethereum–the transaction goes into what’s known as a “transaction pool”, or “txpool” for short. This is essentially a queue of transactions that are waiting to be added to a block and recorded to the blockchain. There are mechanisms that determine which transactions are “picked up” and included in the next block, and there is currently a lot of research surrounding how this decision gets made. In Bitcoin, the transaction pool was referred to as the “memory pool”, or “mempool”, and often these terms are used interchangeably."
Merge,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/mɜrdʒ/,"Finalized in September 2022, the Merge was the culmination of years of work involved in transitioning Ethereum from a Proof of Work consensus model, to Proof of Stake, all while keeping the network live. This was successful, and reduced the network’s carbon footprint by more than 99.9%."
Merkle Patricia trie,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmɜrkl pəˈtrɪʃə traɪ/,"Often referred to simply as a 'Merkle trie' (pronounced 'tree'), a Merkle Patricia trie is a data structure in which a single hash code function (see 'hash') splits into smaller branches. In a similar way to a family tree, where a parent branch splits into child branches, which are then extrapolated into grandchild branches, a Merkle Patricia trie keeps a record of the filiation and history of each element. This type of data structure enables for faster verification on a blockchain network."
MEV,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈmæksɪməl ɪkˈstræktəbl ˈvæljuː/, /ˈɛm iː ˈviː/","Acronym; originally known as Miner Extractable Value, MEV is a broad complex topic that refers to the inclusion, exclusion, and reordering of transactions within a block in order to extract more value from it, generally in excess of what a validator (or miner, on PoW networks) would earn from producing the block. MEV includes activities such as frontrunning, arbitrage, and what could be considered malicious actions to profit off of other users' transactions. This is a very active topic of research that is changing rapidly."

miner tip,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmaɪnər tɪp/,"The miner tip is the Maximum Priority Fee that incentivizes the miner to prioritize a transaction. Learn the basics of blockchains and Ethereum (miners and validators, gas, cryptocurrencies and NFTs, block explorer, networks, etc.)"
mining,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmaɪnɪŋ/,"The process by which blocks or transactions are verified and added to a blockchain using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. In order to verify a block, a miner must use a computer to solve a cryptographic problem. Once the computer has solved the problem, the block is considered “mined” or verified. On Bitcoin or other PoW blockchains, the first computer to mine or verify the block receives bitcoin, or the equivalent network token, as a reward."
mint,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/mɪnt/,Minting refers to the act of publishing a token on the blockchain to make it transferrable and purchasable.
mnemonic phrase,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/nɪˈmɒnɪk freɪz/,"This is an alternative way of referring to a Secret Recovery Phrase, also known as a 'seed phrase': a series of words that correspond to a very long cryptographic key, used to generate and control all the addresses of a crypto wallet."
modular blockchain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmɒdjʊlər ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/,"Bitcoin is an example of a monolithic blockchain: all of the functions of the network (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) are run on one chain. This has significant drawbacks (see 'blockchain trilemma' for more). A modular blockchain, on the other hand, separates some or all of these functions into separate chains, each one optimized for its specific function, and relying on the other chains for the other functions. Ethereum is currently moving towards modularization, both on a protocol level beginning with the Merge, which split consensus and execution into two chains, and at the level of 'Layer 2' networks which provide optimized execution environments, and then 'roll up' their data to Ethereum for its consensus functionality."
multi-sig,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈmʌltiˌsɪɡ/,"multi-signature wallet (multisig) A crypto-asset wallet which requires multiple keys in order to access and transact.

NFT,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɛn ɛf ˈtiː/,"When discussing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), “fungibility” refers to an object’s ability to be exchanged for another. For example, an individual dollar is considered fungible, as one dollar is fully interchangeable with another. Artwork is usually deemed non-fungible, as paintings or sculptures are likely to be unequal between them in quality, value, or other attributes. A non-fungible token is a type of token that is a unique digital asset and has no equal token. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like ether that are fungible in nature."
NFT aggregator,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɛn ɛf ˈtiː ˌæɡrɪˈɡeɪtər/,"In the initial wave of interest in buying and selling NFTs, a number of NFT marketplaces--websites where you can buy and sell NFTs--were created. As the market matured, aggregators appeared, which offer the user the ability to view available stock and price, buy and sell across marketplaces from a single unified application. Similar to familiar web2 shopping portals, these have come to be known as NFT Marketplace Aggregators, or just NFT Aggregators."
NFT drop,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ɛn ɛf ˈtiː drɒp/,"An NFT drop happens when a new NFT collection is released. NFT drops can vary in both how the NFTs are sold (listed for sale or auction), and in who they’re released to (the public, or a specific list called an “allowlist”).   Often, NFT drops coincide with when the NFTs in the collection are minted, that is, written to the blockchain. You might hear these terms used interchangeably— a drop might be referred to as the project’s mint."
node,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/noʊd/,"Public blockchains consist of a network of computers which sync the network's data, coordinate transaction requests, and participate in consensus regarding the validity of those transactions; each one of these computers is called a 'node'.

nonce,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/nɒns/,"The word ‘nonce’ has a few different meanings, and in different contexts, it ends up getting used a lot of different ways. Originally formed from a contraction of a phrase meaning “not more than once”, on the Ethereum Mainnet, “nonce” refers to a unique transaction identification number that increases in value with each successive transaction in order to ensure various safety features (such as preventing a double-spend). Note that due to its broader use in cryptography, you may encounter ‘nonce’ being used differently on other sidechains or decentralized projects."
off-chain,adjective,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌɒfˈtʃeɪn/,"A transaction that is processed outside the blockchain network with an increased speed and reduced cost. There are two different transactions that occur on the blockchain: On-chain transactions are those reflected on the distributed ledger and are visible to all the network users. On the other hand, off-chain transactions occur outside the blockchain network. Such a transaction doesn’t need the services of miners because no ledger verification is conducted. Unlike on-chain transactions, off-chain transactions can be made instantly. This method entails lower fees, happens instantly, and offers more anonymity."
ommer block,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈɒmər blɒk/,"Under the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, miners received rewards for being the first to mine a new block. However, at times a block would be mined just after, and in competition with, the last block. This block, known as an ommer and previously as an uncle, could get rolled into subsequent blocks and the miner of the original ommer would get a partial block reward. All of this functionality was deprecated as of the launch of the Beacon Chain."
on-chain,adjective,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌɒnˈtʃeɪn/,"On-chain, as the name implies, refers to blockchain transactions that exist on and have been verified to the blockchain by miners or validators. On-Chain also means that transactions have been recorded to the blockchain"

permission,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/pərˈmɪʃən/,
permissioned ledger,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/pərˈmɪʃənd ˈlɛdʒər/,"A blockchain network in which access to ledger or network requires permission from an individual or group of individuals, as opposed to a public blockchain. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. Consensus on a permissioned ledger is conducted by the trusted actors, such as government departments, banks, or other known entities. Permissioned blockchains or ledgers contain highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is much easier to maintain and considerably faster than a public blockchain. For example, Quorum or Hyperledger Besu are permissioned ledgers that can be more easily set up for large enterprises. In contrast, the public Ethereum blockchain is a permissionless ledger which anyone can access."

PoS,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈpruːf əv steɪk/, /ˌpiː oʊ ˈɛs/","Initialism; Proof of Stake. A consensus mechanism in which an individual node, or “validator”, validates transactions or blocks. Validators lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency, such as ether, into a ‘stake’, in order to be able to participate in consensus. If the node validates a block (group of transactions) correctly, then the validator receives a reward. Conversely, if the validator behaves poorly by validating incorrect transactions or by not maintaining sufficient network connectivity, the cryptocurrency they staked can be ‘slashed’, or taken from them and put out of circulation (‘burned’). PoS requires a negligible amount of computing power compared to Proof of Work consensus."

The computational process involved in committing a series of transactions into a block on the network, known as ‘hashing a block’, is technically quite simple, and therefore subject to attack. Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network.  For each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency. PoW is singificantly more energy-intensive than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake."
priority fee,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpraɪərɪti fiː/,"The priority fee, also referred to as the 'miner tip', incentivizes the miner to prioritize your transaction.  Naturally, whether this does actually go to a miner depends on the consensus mechanism they use: Ethereum mainnet became a Proof of Stake network following the Merge in September 2022, so the priority fee goes to validators instead of miners."
private blockchain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpraɪvɪt ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/,A blockchain or distributed ledger that has a closed network wherein participants are controlled by a single entity. A private blockchain requires a verification process for new participants. A private blockchain may also limit which individuals are able to participate in consensus of the blockchain network. See also 'permissioned ledger'.
private currency,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpraɪvɪt ˈkʌrənsi/,"A currency or token issued by a private individual or firm. Typically, the token or currency is limited to use within the network of that particular firm or individual. This is not to be confused with a “privacy cryptocurrency”, which are cryptocurrencies with specific privacy features, such as hidden user identities."
private key,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpraɪvɪt kiː/,"A private key is an alphanumeric string of data that, in MetaMask, corresponds to a single specific account in a wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password that enables an individual to control a specific crypto account. Never reveal your private key to anyone, as whoever controls the private key controls the account funds. If you lose your private key, then you lose access to, and control over, that account."
protocol,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈproʊtəkɒl/,"Formally speaking, a 'protocol' is a set of rules governing how a process is carried out. This concept is used throughout public blockchain networks and web3 to refer to the way smart contracts execute their functionality in the same way regardless of the user. The products or services built on top of smart contracts are often referred to as 'protocols' by extension."
public address,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpʌblɪk ˈædrɛs/,"An Ethereum public address, also known as an Ethereum account address, is a string of 42 characters (including letters and numbers) that is used to receive or send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens on the Ethereum network.  Each Ethereum public address is unique and is associated with a private key that allows the owner of the address to sign and authorize transactions. The public address is derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm, and it can be shared with others to receive payments or tokens.  When sending Ethereum or tokens, users need to specify the recipient's public address as the destination for the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the Ethereum or tokens are transferred to the recipient's address."
public blockchain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpʌblɪk ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/,"A globally open network wherein anyone can participate in transactions, participate in the consensus protocol to help determine which blocks get added to the chain, maintain and examine the contents of the chain."
public key,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈpʌblɪk kiː/,"Public blockchain networks are just that: public. Their data is accessible and readable by anyone. In order to have any degree of usability when it comes to allowing users to do some things, like send transactions, but not others, like steal other peoples’ tokens, cryptographic technology is used. In particular, a design paradigm known as ‘public/private key pairs’ is employed to ensure users can interact with others on the network as they wish, while keeping their own account secure.  These key pairs consist of two long strings of alphanumeric characters. A public key can be derived mathematically from its corresponding private key, but the inverse is not true: it is mathematically impossible to derive a private key from its corresponding public key. This allows, for example, users to have a public wallet address that anyone can use to send them tokens, with the peace of mind that as long as they properly keep the corresponding private key safe, those tokens cannot be stolen. See also ‘private key’."

relayer,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈriːleɪər/,"A relayer is an intermediary that facilitates the exchange or transfer of information, assets, or services between two or more parties. The term is used in various fields, including finance, communication, and technology.  In the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, a relayer typically refers to an intermediary that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized network. This can include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where relayers act as matching engines to connect buyers and sellers of digital assets. A few examples of popular relayers include 0x: 0x is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables the creation of relayers on the Ethereum blockchain. These relayers can be built by anyone and allow for peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.  Kyber Network: Kyber Network is a decentralized liquidity network that also operates as a relayer. It enables users to trade a wide range of digital assets, including ERC-20 tokens, without the need for a centralized intermediary.  Uniswap: Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange that operates as a relayer. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) system to enable peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.  AirSwap: AirSwap is a decentralized exchange that operates as a peer-to-peer relayer on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses an off-chain order book to match buyers and sellers and execute trades."
rollups,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈrɒlʌps/,"Rollups (pronounced 'roll ups') are one element in the set of tools and infrastructure being built as scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They consist, in general, of networks which prioritize their ability to compute transactions and smart contract functionality, and then 'roll up' those transactions to Ethereum Mainnet for secure verification of their validity. There are different ways of approaching this problem from a technical point of view, namely Zero Knowledge, or ZK, rollups, and Optimistic rollups. Arbitrum and Optimism are prominent examples. See the entries on both of these types of rollup for more, and more in-depth discussion here."
rug pull,verb,blockchain/crypto term,/rʌɡ pʊl/,"Similar to the traditional financial scam of a pyramid scheme, a 'rug pull' is a cryptocurrency or crypto-token based scam in which the creators of the token create hype, through injecting liquidity into their token, airdropping, and other schemes, and once investors pile in and boost the price of the token up to a certain point, the creators liquidate their (generally majority) share of the tokens, leaving their investors with next to nothing."
Satoshi Nakamoto,person,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsətoʊʃi nəˈkoʊtoʊmi/,"A pseudonymous individual or entity who created the Bitcoin protocol, solving the digital currency issue of the “double spend.” Nakamoto first published their white paper describing the project in 2008, and the first Bitcoin software was released one year later."

scaling,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈskeɪlɪŋ/,"The main goal of scalability is to increase transaction speed (faster finality), and transaction throughput (high transactions per second), without sacrificing decentralization or security."
Scrypt,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈskrɪpt/,"An alternative proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to SHA-256, used in Bitcoin mining. Scrypt mining relies more heavily on memory than on pure CPU power, aiming to reduce the advantage that ASICs. Scrypt"
Secret Recovery Phrase,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsiːkrɪt rɪˈkʌvəri freɪz/,"The seed phrase, mnemonic, or Secret Recovery Phrase is a crucial part of public blockchain technology, originally created for Bitcoin, and goes by many names. However, they all refer to a set of ordered words which correspond to determined values. These values never change, and therefore the same string of words in the same order will always produce the same number–this is the underlying functionality that allows seed phrases to back up wallets. This is also where the name ‘hierarchical deterministic wallets’ comes from, as all the accounts in a given wallet are deterministically created from the seed phrase, and they are hierarchically controlled by it. A Secret Recovery Phrase is exactly what it sounds like: something that is secret, and should be known only to the owner of the account. If the seed phrase is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the account; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc. What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your crypto wallet secure"
seed phrase,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/siːd freɪz/,Another term for Secret Recovery Phrase
self-custody,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsɛlfˈkʌstədi/,"Self-custodial' refers to the fact that it's you ('self') who holds your wallet's private key(s). A self-custodial wallet eliminates the third party between you and your crypto-assets, which is more suitable for some people."
self-executing,adjective,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsɛlfɪɡˈzɛkjʊtɪŋ/,A smart contract is a self-executing contract: a computer program that automatically executes the terms of a contract when certain conditions are met.
Serenity,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/sɛˈrɛnɪti/,"The Ethereum network is working on a series of technical upgrades that will allow massive increases in transaction throughput, amongst other things. The plan that outlined these changes was originally referred to as 'Serenity', although that name has become less popular, in favor of specific descriptions of the upgrades themselves."
serialization,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˌsɪəriəˈleɪʃən/,The process of converting a data structure into a sequence of bytes. Ethereum internally uses an encoding format called recursive-length prefix encoding (RLP).
shard chain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ʃɑːrd tʃeɪn/,A proof-of-stake chain that is coordinated by the Beacon Chain and secured by validators. There will be 64 added to the network as part of the shard chain upgrade. Shard chains will offer increased transaction throughput for Ethereum by providing additional data to layer 2 solutions like optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups.
sharding,verb,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈʃɑːrdɪŋ/,"Sharding, in public blockchains, refers to splitting an entire network into multiple portions, called “shards.” Each shard would contain its own independent state, meaning a unique set of account balances and smart contracts. Sharding is currently being investigated and developed as one of the set of tools and solutions for scaling Ethereum."
shielded transaction,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈʃiːldɪd trænˈzækʃən/,A shielded transaction is essentially a transaction that is between two shielded addresses. Shielded Transaction
sidechain,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsaɪdˌtʃeɪn/,"A ‘sidechain’ refers to a chain that is connected to another (most often, to Ethereum) through a bridge, allowing assets to be transferred between them. In contrast to a Layer 2 network or a rollup, a sidechain is a full blockchain network in and of itself, and does not rely on Ethereum for consensus. It therefore must be evaluated independently in terms of its security, stability, and other features. See also “blockchain trilemma”, “modular blockchain”.  Note: Bridges exist for good reason; sending tokens from a sidechain to Ethereum mainnet or vice versa would result in token loss."
signature,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈsɪɡnətʃər/, /ˌkrɪptəˈɡræfɪk/","In the context of public blockchain networks, a ""signature"" is generally a cryptographic signature, generated by a public-private key pair. See 'Digital signature'"
slashing condition,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈslæʃɪŋ kənˈdɪʃən/,"Under a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, a slashing condition is one that causes the validator's deposit to be destroyed when they trigger it. See also 'Proof of Stake'."
slippage,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈslɪpɪdʒ/,Slippage is the expected percentage difference between a quoted and an executed price.
slot,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/slɒt/,"In Proof of Stake consensus in Ethereum, a 'slot' is a period of time equivalent to 12 seconds; 32 slots make up an 'epoch'. Slots are significant in that for each slot, a different validator node is randomly chosen to propose blocks to the network, and a different committee of validators are chosen to vote on whether each block is valid"
smart contract,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/smɑːrt ˈkɒntrækt/,"Smart contracts are programs that have been published on a public blockchain, and can be used by anyone. While they often contain agreements or sets of actions between parties that emulate a traditional legal contract, they are not, in and of themselves, legal documents. Smart contracts are automated actions that can be coded and executed once a set of conditions is met, and are the dominant form of programming on the Ethereum Virtual Machine."
soft fork,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/sɒft fɔrk/,"A change to the blockchain protocol resulting in only previously valid blocks and transactions being made invalid. Since old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. However, this can result in a potential divide in the blockchain, as the old software generates blocks that read as invalid according to the new rules. Contrast with 'hard fork'; for more basic information regarding forks, see 'fork'."
stablecoin,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsteɪblˌkɔɪn/,"A cryptocurrency whose value has been ‘pegged’ to that of something considered a ‘stable’ asset, like fiat currency or gold. It theoretically remains stable in price, as it is measured against a known amount of an asset which should be less subject to fluctuation. Always spelled as one word. User Guide: Tokens"
staking,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsteɪkɪŋ/,"On the Ethereum Proof of Stake network, those wishing to participate in consensus must first lock up, or ‘stake’, 32 ETH into a smart contract; this ETH may be ‘slashed’ (taken from them and ‘burned’, put out of circulation) in the event that their validator behaves maliciously or does not meet performance requirements. Similar Proof of Stake mechanisms are in operation on other networks, as well.  Although this is the canonical meaning of the word, similar actions taken at the level of a decentralized exchange (DEX) or another dapp are often called ‘staking’, though it would probably be more accurate and descriptive to just call this ‘locking up tokens’."
state,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/steɪt/,"The set of data that a blockchain network strictly needs to keep track of, and that represents data currently relevant to applications on the chain."
state channels,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/steɪt ˈtʃænəlz/,"State channels are part of the set of tools and platforms involved in scaling Ethereum. While a complex topic, state channels are essentially methods through which the current 'state' of the blockchain can be exported, and then based on that, any given number of transactions can take place off-chain, and then be moved back onto the main Ethereum chain."
streaming,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈstriːmɪŋ/,Money streaming represents the idea of continuous payments over time. Block numbers are used to measure time in the blockchain and continuously update the balances of the parties in the contract.
swap,verb,blockchain/crypto term,/swɒp/,"As the number of different blockchain projects and tokens has proliferated, the system by which users exchange one token for another has come to be known as 'swapping', and the individual action, 'a swap', or in the verb form, 'to swap.'

szabo,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈsæboʊ/,A denomination of ETH. See also 'ether (denominations)'.
testnet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtɛstˌnɛt/,"A testnet is a blockchain network that mirrors, as closely as possible, the current conditions of a corresponding ‘main’ network. Testnets are used by developers to verify that their smart contracts and other functionality work as intended, before permanently recording their code to a live blockchain network (and often spending significant gas fees in the process!).  Tokens minted on testnets are not transferrable for their equivalent value on mainnets."
testnet,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtɛstˌnɛt/,
token,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtoʊkən/,A token represents an asset issued on an existing blockchain; the transfer of tokens and the addresses that currently hold them are the subject of the network’s consensus activities. There are many types of tokens; see also ‘ERC-20’ and ‘ERC-721’ entries.
token lockup,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtoʊkən ˈlɒkʌp/,"A token lock-up refers to a mechanism where certain tokens or cryptocurrency holdings are locked up or frozen for a specified period of time to restrict their transfer or sale. This is often used in the context of initial coin offerings (ICOs), where token issuers may require investors to commit to holding onto their tokens for a certain period, typically to ensure that investors are committed to the project's long-term success.  Token lock-up periods can vary in duration and can be predetermined or set according to certain conditions, such as reaching a certain milestone, liquidity event or network upgrade. During the lock-up period, the tokens cannot be transferred or sold, although in some cases, they may be staked or used to participate in certain network activities. Once the lock-up period is over, the tokens can be freely traded or sold."
token standard,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtoʊkən ˈstændərd/,"See ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc."

transaction fee,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/trænˈzækʃən fiː/,"A small fee imposed on transactions sent across a blockchain network. These fees are used to pay network validators or miners for their participation in consensus, and thus ensure that a blockchain network is self-sustaining."
transaction ID,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/trænˈzækʃən ˈaɪˈdiː/,"A transaction hash/ID (often abbreviated as tx hash or txn hash) is a unique identifier, similar to a receipt, that serves as proof that a transaction was validated and added to the blockchain. In many cases, a transaction hash is needed in order to locate funds."
transaction pool,noun,blockchain/crypto term,/trænˈzækʃən puːl/,"When a user submits a transaction to the Ethereum network--or many other networks based on Ethereum--the transaction goes into what's know as a 'transaction pool', or 'txpool' for short. This is essentially a queue of transactions that are waiting to be added to a block and recorded to the blockchain. There are mechanisms that determine which transactions are 'picked up' and included in the next block, and there is currently a lot of research surrounding how this decision gets made (see 'MEV'). In Bitcoin, the transaction pool was referred to as the 'memory pool', or 'mempool', and often these terms are used interchangeably."
trustless,adjective,blockchain/crypto term,/ˈtrʌstlɪs/,"Trustless' is a term that gets used a lot in the decentralized web, and it deserves some explanation. Traditionally, to call something 'trustless' would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a centralized entity that 'must be trusted' as the source of truth. With public blockchain networks, data isn't kept on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. This is why the term 'trustless' was coined: there is no need for trust, although, in a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust between people, because the system is guaranteed to work the same for everyone."
TVL,noun,blockchain/crypto term,"/ˈtoʊtəl ˈvæljuː ˈlɒkt/, /ˌtiː ˈviː ˈɛl/","Initialism; Total Value Locked, or TVL, is a common expression used in many contexts across the crypto ecosystem, so it's important to pay attention to the specifics. In general, it refers to how much value, in tokens, has been deposited into something. Most often, it refers to a protocol, which is an application on the blockchain, or a set of protocols. For example, a decentralized token trading platform might have a series of liquidity pools, which are protocols enabling swaps between tokens, and the platform may quote the 'TVL' for all the pools combined. Alternatively, if a network uses proof of stake for their consensus mechanism, they may represent the TVL of all the tokens staked into that consensus protocol."

While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in public blockchain systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current state of the network when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the state of the network for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a network running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the network's ability to reach consensus on its current state. Therefore, a network that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant."
compile,verb,software term,/ˈkɑmpaɪlɪŋ/,"There are many languages in computing and software programming. In general, 'low-level' languages are those actually processed by the computer's operating system or processor, while 'high-level' languages are those typed in by software developers making programs. Compiling, then, is converting code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., Solidity) into a lower-level language (e.g., EVM bytecode)."

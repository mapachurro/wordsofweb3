attestation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌætɪˈsteɪʃən/,"Attestation in crypto refers to the process of verifying the authenticity or validity of a piece of information or a transaction on a blockchain network. Attestation is an important aspect of blockchain technology, as it helps to ensure the integrity and security of the network. In general, attestation involves a trusted third-party, or attester, verifying the authenticity of a transaction or piece of information. This can include verifying the identity of users on the network, verifying the accuracy of data, or validating the authenticity of a digital signature. One example of attestation in crypto is the use of digital signatures to authenticate transactions on a blockchain network. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to verify the identity of the sender and ensure that the transaction has not been tampered with. Another example of attestation in crypto is the use of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which rely on validators to attest to the validity of transactions on the network. Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, and they are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts. For more info, see Attestation in Ethereum.",,

In a CEX, the exchange company or organization acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, holding and managing the assets on behalf of its users. Centralized exchanges typically offer a wide range of trading pairs, with many popular cryptocurrencies available for trade. They also usually have high liquidity and offer advanced trading features such as margin trading, order types, and charting tools. However, centralized exchanges also have several drawbacks. They are often targeted by hackers, as the centralized nature of the exchange makes them a single point of failure. They also require users to trust the exchange to hold their funds securely and execute trades fairly, which can be a source of concern for some users.",,
CEX,noun,decentralized web,/ˈsiːˈɛks/,Acronym; see 'Centralized Exchange'.,,
chain ID,noun,decentralized web,/tʃeɪn ˈaɪˈdiː/,"A chain ID is a unique identifier that represents a blockchain network. We use it to distinguish different blockchain networks from each other and to ensure that transactions and messages are sent to the correct network. Ethereum networks have two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the same value, they have different uses. Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the network ID, while the transaction signature process uses the chain ID",,

A client usually includes a cryptocurrency software wallet.",,
coin,noun,decentralized web,/kɔɪn/,"The term 'coin' has some nuances. Strictly speaking, a 'coin' could be defined as: A fungible token (all of them identical) issued on a blockchain, either as the network's transactional token, or through a smart contract deployed to that network. Some people may use 'coins' as shorthand for 'bitcoin'; the immortal aphorism 'not your keys, not your coins' refers to bitcoins. Another thing to keep in mind is that, while coins are put forward as some sort of representation of value, that value can vary wildly from one 'coin' to another. A coin may represent the value of the computational resources of the network, or it may be 'pegged' to represent fiat currency value, or it may float according to the value placed on immaterial resources like NFTs, membership, or digital goods, to name a few.",,

cold wallet,noun,decentralized web,/koʊld ˈwɔlɪt/ /koʊld ˈstɔrɪdʒ/,"An offline wallet that is never connected to the internet. These are often referred to as ""airgapped"" or ""cold storage"" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a ""hot"" wallet, connected to the Internet, is ""ready to use on chain"", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.",,
confirmation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.",,
consensus,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs/,"The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.",,

Crypto wallets come in different forms, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and paper wallets.",,
crypto-,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-/,"Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.",,

If cryptocurrency is web3’s monetary system, its financial system is DeFi. This includes familiar concepts like loans and interest-bearing financial instruments, as well as so-called “DeFi primitives”, novel solutions like token swapping and liquidity pools. The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of liquidity. This is in contrast with a centralized exchange, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there are so-called on-ramp providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on deposit” the way a centralized exchange does.

encrypted keys,noun,decentralized web,/ɛnˈkrɪptɪd vs ʌnˈɛnkrɪptɪd kiːz/,"As discussed elsewhere, public and private cryptographic key pairs are one of the technologies that underpins cryptocurrencies and 'crypto' tech in general. In MetaMask, an unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to unlock or restore wallets. An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption. Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe. By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’.

PoW,noun,decentralized web,"/ˈpruːf əv wɜrk/, /ˌpiː oʊ ˈdʌbəljuː/","Initialism; Proof of Work.A consensus mechanism in which each block is ‘mined’ by one of the nodes, or a group of nodes, on the network. The computational process involved in committing a series of transactions into a block on the network, known as ‘hashing a block’, is technically quite simple, and therefore subject to attack. Under PoW, each miner must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their block to the network as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each block becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the difficulty of successfully hashing each block, and consequently the security of the network. For each hashed block, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered Proof of Work, and the miner that successfully hashes the block first receives a reward, in the form of cryptocurrency. PoW is singificantly more energy-intensive than other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake.",,
priority fee,noun,decentralized web,/ˈpraɪərɪti fiː/,"The priority fee, also referred to as the 'miner tip', incentivizes the miner to prioritize your transaction. Naturally, whether this does actually go to a miner depends on the consensus mechanism they use: Ethereum mainnet became a Proof of Stake network following the Merge in September 2022, so the priority fee goes to validators instead of miners.",,
private blockchain,noun,decentralized web,/ˈpraɪvɪt ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/,A blockchain or distributed ledger that has a closed network wherein participants are controlled by a single entity. A private blockchain requires a verification process for new participants. A private blockchain may also limit which individuals are able to participate in consensus of the blockchain network.

public address,noun,decentralized web,/ˈpʌblɪk ˈædrɛs/,"An Ethereum public address, also known as an Ethereum account address, is a string of 42 characters (including letters and numbers) that is used to receive or send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens on the Ethereum network. Each Ethereum public address is unique and is associated with a private key that allows the owner of the address to sign and authorize transactions. The public address is derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm, and it can be shared with others to receive payments or tokens. When sending Ethereum or tokens, users need to specify the recipient's public address as the destination for the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed by the network, the Ethereum or tokens are transferred to the recipient's address.",,
public blockchain,noun,decentralized web,/ˈpʌblɪk ˈblɒkˌtʃeɪn/,"A globally open network wherein anyone can participate in transactions, participate in the consensus protocol to help determine which blocks get added to the chain, maintain and examine the contents of the chain.",,
public key,noun,decentralized web,/ˈpʌblɪk kiː/,"Public blockchain networks are just that: public. Their data is accessible and readable by anyone. In order to have any degree of usability when it comes to allowing users to do some things, like send transactions, but not others, like steal other peoples’ tokens, cryptographic technology is used. In particular, a design paradigm known as ‘public/private key pairs’ is employed to ensure users can interact with others on the network as they wish, while keeping their own account secure. These key pairs consist of two long strings of alphanumeric characters. A public key can be derived mathematically from its corresponding private key, but the inverse is not true: it is mathematically impossible to derive a private key from its corresponding public key. This allows, for example, users to have a public wallet address that anyone can use to send them tokens, with the peace of mind that as long as they properly keep the corresponding private key safe, those tokens cannot be stolen.

relayer,noun,decentralized web,/ˈriːleɪər/,"A relayer is an intermediary that facilitates the exchange or transfer of information, assets, or services between two or more parties. The term is used in various fields, including finance, communication, and technology. In the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, a relayer typically refers to an intermediary that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions on a decentralized network. This can include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where relayers act as matching engines to connect buyers and sellers of digital assets. A few examples of popular relayers include 0x: 0x is a decentralized exchange protocol that enables the creation of relayers on the Ethereum blockchain. These relayers can be built by anyone and allow for peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens. Kyber Network: Kyber Network is a decentralized liquidity network that also operates as a relayer. It enables users to trade a wide range of digital assets, including ERC-20 tokens, without the need for a centralized intermediary. Uniswap: Uniswap is a popular decentralized exchange that operates as a relayer. It uses an automated market maker (AMM) system to enable peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens. AirSwap: AirSwap is a decentralized exchange that operates as a peer-to-peer relayer on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses an off-chain order book to match buyers and sellers and execute trades.",,
rollups,noun,decentralized web,/ˈrɒlʌps/,"Rollups (pronounced 'roll ups') are one element in the set of tools and infrastructure being built as scaling solutions for the Ethereum network. They consist, in general, of networks which prioritize their ability to compute transactions and smart contract functionality, and then 'roll up' those transactions to Ethereum Mainnet for secure verification of their validity. There are different ways of approaching this problem from a technical point of view, namely Zero Knowledge, or ZK, rollups, and Optimistic rollups. Arbitrum and Optimism are prominent examples. See the entries on both of these types of rollup for more, and more in-depth discussion here.",,
rug pull,verb,decentralized web,/rʌɡ pʊl/,"Similar to the traditional financial scam of a pyramid scheme, a 'rug pull' is a cryptocurrency or crypto-token based scam in which the creators of the token create hype, through injecting liquidity into their token, airdropping, and other schemes, and once investors pile in and boost the price of the token up to a certain point, the creators liquidate their (generally majority) share of the tokens, leaving their investors with next to nothing.",,

Secret Recovery Phrase,noun,decentralized web,/ˈsiːkrɪt rɪˈkʌvəri freɪz/,"The seed phrase, mnemonic, or Secret Recovery Phrase is a crucial part of public blockchain technology, originally created for Bitcoin, and goes by many names. However, they all refer to a set of ordered words which correspond to determined values. These values never change, and therefore the same string of words in the same order will always produce the same number–this is the underlying functionality that allows seed phrases to back up wallets. This is also where the name ‘hierarchical deterministic wallets’ comes from, as all the accounts in a given wallet are deterministically created from the seed phrase, and they are hierarchically controlled by it. A Secret Recovery Phrase is exactly what it sounds like: something that is secret, and should be known only to the owner of the account. If the seed phrase is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the account; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc.    What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your crypto wallet secure",,

In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a centralized entity that 'must be trusted' as the source of truth. With public blockchain networks, data isn't kept on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. This is why the term 'trustless' was coined: there is no need for trust, although, in a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust between people, because the system is guaranteed to work the same for everyone.",,

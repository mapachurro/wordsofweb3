While applicable in many realms of technology, this becomes of particular interest in public blockchain systems: how do we ensure that we can agree on the current state of the network when there is an incentive, often a significant financial incentive, to subvert the state of the network for one's own profit? On a more basic level, if we're coordinating a network running around the world on all kinds of different hardware and software, there are all kinds or problems that can occur that hinder the network's ability to reach consensus on its current state. Therefore, a network that has been designed and implemented to be resistant to these sorts of failures, either due to malicious intent or technical failure, is said to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant.","","","","","",""

EIP-1559 will change Ethereum’s fee market mechanism. Fundamentally, EIP-1559 gets rid of the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation. In first-price auctions, people bid a set amount of money to pay for their transaction to be processed, and the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, there will be a discrete “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. For users or applications that want to prioritize their transaction, they can add a “tip,” which is called a “priority fee” to pay a miner for faster inclusion.","","","","","",""

Permissioned blockchains or ledgers contain highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is much easier to maintain and considerably faster than a public blockchain. For example, Quorum or Hyperledger Besu are permissioned ledgers that can be more easily set up for large enterprises. In contrast, the public Ethereum blockchain is a permissionless ledger which anyone can access.","","","","","",""

However, they all refer to a set of ordered words which correspond to determined values. These values never change, and therefore the same string of words in the same order will always produce the same number–this is the underlying functionality that allows seed phrases to back up wallets. This is also where the name ‘hierarchical deterministic wallets’ comes from, as all the accounts in a given wallet are deterministically created from the seed phrase, and they are hierarchically controlled by it.
A Secret Recovery Phrase is exactly what it sounds like: something that is secret, and should be known only to the owner of the account. If the seed phrase is given to someone else, that person has complete control over the account; they can drain it of tokens and funds, execute transactions with it, etc. What is a ‘Secret Recovery Phrase’ and how to keep your crypto wallet secure","","","","","",""

Traditionally, to call something 'trustless' would sound like a negative thing. In the context of decentralized technology, it has a more technical meaning: since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a centralized entity that 'must be trusted' as the source of truth. With public blockchain networks, data isn't kept on some centralized server somewhere that could be hacked or changed arbitrarily; anyone can verify the transactions themselves. This is why the term 'trustless' was coined: there is no need for trust, although, in a way, the rules and assurances built into the blockchain provide the basis for greater trust between people, because the system is guaranteed to work the same for everyone.","https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/trustless","","","https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/trustless","2025-01-31",""

For example, a decentralized token trading platform might have a series of liquidity pools, which are protocols enabling swaps between tokens, and the platform may quote the 'TVL' for all the pools combined.

By way of example: if the world ‘Apple’ was your private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’.

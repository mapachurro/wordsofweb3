## How to Submit

You can make your suggestion in either:

1. Narrative form

2. JSON format (preferred)

### Narrative Form Example

"We should add the term 'stonks' because everybody in Discord says it. The definition should be 'A meme meaning the value of something is good. Or bad.'"

### JSON Format Example

```json
{
    "example-term": {                    // sanitized version of the term (URL-friendly)
        "term": "Example Term",          // the actual term itself
        "partOfSpeech": "noun",         // what grammatical category is it?

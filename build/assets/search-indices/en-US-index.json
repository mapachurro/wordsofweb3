In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS).

These are often referred to as \"airgapped\" or \"cold storage\" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a \"hot\" wallet, connected to the Internet, is \"ready to use on chain\", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.\"\r\nconfirmation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,\"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation.

The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.\"\r\nconsensus client,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈklaɪənt/,\"A consensus client is a component of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network.

Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.\"\r\ncrypto-compliance,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-kəmˈplaɪəns/,A blanket term used to refer to ensuring crypto projects conform with applicable regulations and laws.\r\ncryptoassets,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊˌæsɛts/,\"A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products.\"\r\ncryptocurrency,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkrɪptəˈkɜrənsi/,\"Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds.

The idea here is that a \"hot\" wallet, connected to the Internet, is \"ready to use on chain\", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.\"\r\nconfirmation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,\"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.\"\r\nconsensus,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs/,\"The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.\"\r\nconsensus client,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈklaɪənt/,\"A consensus client is a component of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network. It communicates with other nodes to reach consensus on the current state of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes have a consistent copy of the ledger.

These funds are designed to give investors exposure to the crypto market without the need for them to directly buy and hold cryptocurrencies themselves.\r\ncrypto wallet,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ ˈwɔlɪt/,\"A crypto wallet is a device, physical medium, program or a service which stores the public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. Crypto wallets come in different forms, including software wallets, hardware wallets, and paper wallets.\"\r\ncrypto-,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-/,\"Even though this prefix is originally Greek, our current usage comes from cryptography. Technologies that are referred to with the blanket term of 'crypto' tech are underlain by cryptographic tools and processes (such as public/private key pairs) that enable innovative functionality and security. Of course, 'cryptocurrency' often gets shortened to simply 'crypto', so this emerging field is full of instances where something 'crypto' is being added to or shortened. With the emergence of the term 'Web3', arguably a distinction has begun to be made between 'crypto', referring to DeFi and other financial use cases of the technology, while 'Web3' refers to the transition of Internet-based activities to more decentralized practices and platforms.\"\r\ncrypto-compliance,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊ-kəmˈplaɪəns/,A blanket term used to refer to ensuring crypto projects conform with applicable regulations and laws.\r\ncryptoassets,noun,decentralized web,/ˈkrɪptoʊˌæsɛts/,\"A useful blanket term that covers on-chain assets: cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other, still emerging, products.\"\r\ncryptocurrency,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkrɪptəˈkɜrənsi/,\"Digital currency that is based on mathematics and uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of units of currency as well as verifying the transfer of funds.

In modern times, it often refers to the application of this concept within computing, communication, and data transfer through computers and computer networks. Cryptography has been protected as free speech in the United States, and provides the technological foundation that allows blockchain networks to be public: despite the ledger being open and accessible by all, control over the state of the ledger and the ability to move assets on it is mediated through cryptographic tools, such as the Secret Recovery Phrase.\"\r\nDAO,noun,decentralized web,/daʊ/,Acronym; see 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization'.\r\ndapp,noun,decentralized web,/dæp/,Acronym; see 'decentralized application'\r\ndecentralization,noun,decentralized web,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlɪˈzeɪʃən/,\"The transfer of authority and responsibility from a centralized organization, government, or party to a distributed network.\"\r\ndecentralized application,noun,decentralized web,/ˌdiːsɛntrəlaɪzd ˌæplɪˈkeɪʃən/,\"An open-source software application with backend (not user-facing) code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, rather than a centralized server.

These are often referred to as \"airgapped\" or \"cold storage\" wallets; the usage of temperature as a metaphor is to indicate both the ease with which the assets held in accounts by the wallet can be used on a network, as well as an indicator of risk. The idea here is that a \"hot\" wallet, connected to the Internet, is \"ready to use on chain\", and also has a higher risk of being compromised by bad actors. Cold storage wallets, therefore, offer much greater protection for crypto-held assets and tokens.\"\r\nconfirmation,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnfərˈmeɪʃən/,\"A confirmation happens when a network has verified a blockchain transaction. Under a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, this happens through a process known as mining; under Proof of Stake (PoS), the process is known as validation. Once a transaction is successfully confirmed, it theoretically cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.\"\r\nconsensus,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs/,\"The process used by a group of peers, or nodes, on a blockchain network to agree on the validity of transactions submitted to the network. The consensus layer is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks, and for coordinating communication between nodes to achieve consensus. In a blockchain network, the consensus layer is implemented by the consensus protocol or algorithm that defines how new blocks are added to the chain and how the network reaches agreement on the current state of the ledger. There are various types of consensus mechanisms used in blockchain networks, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The consensus client implements the specific consensus mechanism used by the network and ensures that all nodes follow the rules and reach agreement on the current state of the blockchain.\"\r\nconsensus client,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈklaɪənt/,\"A consensus client is a component of a blockchain node that is responsible for validating and verifying transactions and blocks in the network. It communicates with other nodes to reach consensus on the current state of the blockchain and to ensure that all nodes have a consistent copy of the ledger. See also: \"consensus mechanism\".\"\r\nconsensus mechanism,noun,decentralized web,/kənˈsɛnsəs ˈleɪər/,Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) allow distributed systems (networks of computers) to work together and stay secure.\r\nConstantinople fork,noun,decentralized web,/ˌkɒnstænˈtɪnəpl fɔːrk/,\"One of the 'hard forks' made to the Ethereum network, in February 2019.

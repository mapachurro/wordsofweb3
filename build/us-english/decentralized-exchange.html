    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A decentralized <a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a> (<a href="./dex.html">DEX</a>) is a platform for exchanging cryptocurrencies based on functionality programmed on the <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> (i.e., in smart contracts). If <a href="./cryptocurrency.html">cryptocurrency</a> is <a href="./web3.html">web3</a>’s monetary system, its financial system is <a href="./defi.html">DeFi</a>. This includes familiar concepts like loans and interest-bearing financial instruments, as well as so-called “<a href="./defi.html">DeFi</a> primitives”, novel solutions like <a href="./token.html">token</a> swapping and <a href="./liquidity.html">liquidity</a> pools. The trading is peer-to-peer, or between pools of <a href="./liquidity.html">liquidity</a>. This is in contrast with a <a href="./centralized-<a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a>.html">centralized <a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a></a>, which is more akin to a bank or investment firm that specializes in cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there are so-called <a href="./on-ramp.html">on-ramp</a> providers, who could be compared to currency brokers, exchanging traditional “fiat” money for cryptocurrencies, and do not hold customer’s funds “on <a href="./deposit.html">deposit</a>” the way a <a href="./centralized-<a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a>.html">centralized <a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a></a> does. There are important technical and regulatory differences between these, which are constantly evolving.</p>

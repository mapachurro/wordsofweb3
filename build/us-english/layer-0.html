    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Layer 0 in <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> refers to the underlying infrastructure that supports the <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> <a href="./network.html">network</a>. It includes the physical hardware, such as computers, servers, and other <a href="./network.html">network</a> components, as well as the software protocols that govern the interactions between the nodes in the <a href="./network.html">network</a>. In other words, Layer 0 is the foundation upon which the <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> <a href="./network.html">network</a> is built. It provides the necessary resources and technical capabilities for the <a href="./network.html">network</a> to function, such as computing power, storage, and <a href="./network.html">network</a> connectivity. Layer 0 is essential to the operation and security of the <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> <a href="./network.html">network</a>, as it ensures that data is transmitted and stored correctly and securely across the <a href="./network.html">network</a>. Layer 0 is sometimes also referred to as 'Layer Zero' or 'L0'. It is important to note that the concept of Layer 0 is not unique to <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> technology, but is a more general term used to describe the physical and technical infrastructure underlying any type of computer <a href="./network.html">network</a>.</p>

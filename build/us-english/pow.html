    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Initialism; Proof of Work.A <a href="./<a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a>-mechanism.html"><a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a> mechanism</a> in which each <a href="./block.html">block</a> is ‘mined’ by one of the nodes, or a group of nodes, on the <a href="./network.html">network</a>. The computational process involved in committing a series of transactions into a <a href="./block.html">block</a> on the <a href="./network.html">network</a>, known as ‘hashing a <a href="./block.html">block</a>’, is technically quite simple, and therefore subject to attack. Under PoW, each <a href="./miner.html">miner</a> must solve a math problem to find a set, difficult variable in order to be able to propose their <a href="./block.html">block</a> to the <a href="./network.html">network</a> as the next to be ‘mined’. In effect, the process of hashing each <a href="./block.html">block</a> becomes a competition. This addition of solving for a target increases the <a href="./difficulty.html">difficulty</a> of successfully hashing each <a href="./block.html">block</a>, and consequently the security of the <a href="./network.html">network</a>. For each hashed <a href="./block.html">block</a>, the overall process of hashing will have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed <a href="./block.html">block</a> is considered Proof of Work, and the <a href="./miner.html">miner</a> that successfully hashes the <a href="./block.html">block</a> first receives a reward, in the form of <a href="./cryptocurrency.html">cryptocurrency</a>. PoW is singificantly more energy-intensive than other <a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a> mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake.</p>

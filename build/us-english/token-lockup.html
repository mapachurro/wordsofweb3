    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A <a href="./token.html">token</a> lock-up refers to a mechanism where certain tokens or <a href="./cryptocurrency.html">cryptocurrency</a> holdings are locked up or frozen for a specified period of time to restrict their transfer or sale. This is often used in the context of initial <a href="./coin.html">coin</a> offerings (ICOs), where <a href="./token.html">token</a> issuers may require investors to commit to holding onto their tokens for a certain period, typically to ensure that investors are committed to the project's long-term success. Token lock-up periods can vary in duration and can be predetermined or set according to certain conditions, such as reaching a certain milestone, <a href="./liquidity.html">liquidity</a> event or <a href="./network.html">network</a> <a href="./upgrade.html">upgrade</a>. During the lock-up period, the tokens cannot be transferred or sold, although in some cases, they may be staked or used to participate in certain <a href="./network.html">network</a> activities. Once the lock-up period is over, the tokens can be freely traded or sold.</p>

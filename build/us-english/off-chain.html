    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A transaction that is processed outside the blockchain network with an increased speed and reduced cost. There are two different transactions that occur on the blockchain: On-chain transactions are those reflected on the distributed ledger and are visible to all the network users. On the other hand, off-chain transactions occur outside the blockchain network. Such a transaction doesn’t need the services of miners because no ledger verification is conducted. Unlike on-chain transactions, off-chain transactions can be made instantly. This method entails lower fees, happens instantly, and offers more anonymity. </p>

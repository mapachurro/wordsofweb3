    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) The EIP process is a public and open process through which suggestions are made as to how to change (and hopefully, improve) the way the Ethereum network functions as a whole. Individual EIPs are referred to by the name assigned to them in the repository, for example, EIP-1559. EIP-1559 will change Ethereum’s fee market mechanism. Fundamentally, EIP-1559 gets rid of the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation. In first-price auctions, people bid a set amount of money to pay for their transaction to be processed, and the highest bidder wins. With EIP-1559, there will be a discrete “base fee” for transactions to be included in the next block. For users or applications that want to prioritize their transaction, they can add a “tip,” which is called a “priority fee” to pay a miner for faster inclusion.</p>

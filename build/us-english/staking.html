    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> On the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> Proof of Stake <a href="./network.html">network</a>, those wishing to participate in <a href="./consensus.html">consensus</a> must first lock up, or ‘stake’, 32 <a href="./eth.html">ETH</a> into a <a href="./smart-<a href="./contract.html">contract</a>.html">smart <a href="./contract.html">contract</a></a>; this <a href="./eth.html">ETH</a> may be ‘slashed’ (taken from them and ‘burned’, put out of circulation) in the event that their <a href="./validator.html">validator</a> behaves maliciously or does not meet performance requirements. Similar Proof of Stake mechanisms are in operation on other networks, as well. Although this is the canonical meaning of the word, similar actions taken at the level of a <a href="./decentralized-<a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a>.html">decentralized <a href="./exchange.html">exchange</a></a> (<a href="./dex.html">DEX</a>) or another <a href="./dapp.html">dapp</a> are often called ‘staking’, though it would probably be more accurate and descriptive to just call this ‘locking up tokens’.</p>

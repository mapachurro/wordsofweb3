    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Public <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> networks are just that: public. Their data is accessible and readable by anyone. In order to have any degree of usability when it comes to allowing users to do some things, like send transactions, but not others, like steal other peoples’ tokens, cryptographic technology is used. In particular, a design paradigm known as ‘public/<a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> pairs’ is employed to ensure users can interact with others on the <a href="./network.html">network</a> as they wish, while keeping their own <a href="./account.html">account</a> secure. These key pairs consist of two long strings of alphanumeric characters. A public key can be derived mathematically from its corresponding <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a>, but the inverse is not true: it is mathematically impossible to derive a <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> from its corresponding public key. This allows, for example, users to have a public <a href="./wallet.html">wallet</a> <a href="./address.html">address</a> that anyone can use to send them tokens, with the peace of mind that as long as they properly keep the corresponding <a href="./private-key.html">private key</a> safe, those tokens cannot be stolen.

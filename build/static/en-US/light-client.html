    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> In computing, a 'client' is a software that runs or accesses a program made available by a remote computer. With <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> networks, then, clients are the programs that sync <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a> data and participate in network consensus. More often and more specifically, 'Layer 2' is used as a noun, to refer to a type of network that is specifically built to handle a large number of transactions quickly by relying on <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> mainnet for security functions, and optimizing for speed and scale. Examples include <a href="./arbitrum.html">Arbitrum</a> and <a href="./optimism.html">Optimism</a>; this is different from a '<a href="./sidechain.html">sidechain</a>', which is a network that has its own security mechanism, yet still allows compatibility and bridging of assets between itself and <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a>.</p>

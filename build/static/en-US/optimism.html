    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> Optimism is a layer-2 scaling solution for <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a>, which is a <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>-based platform for decentralized applications. It is designed to reduce the cost and increase the speed of transactions on the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> network. Optimism works by using a technique called optimistic rollups, which allows it to process a large number of transactions off-chain, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> network. In optimistic rollups, transactions are initially processed off-chain, and a summary of these transactions is then submitted to the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> network for verification. This verification process ensures that the transactions are valid and that no fraud has occurred. Once the transactions are verified, they are added to the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>, allowing users to interact with the decentralized applications built on the platform.</p>

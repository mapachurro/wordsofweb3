    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> The Gas Station Network (<a href="./gsn.html">GSN</a>) is a decentralized network of relayers mainly referring to the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> <a href="./blockchain.html">blockchain</a>. It allows you to build dapps which provide payment for transactions, so users do not need to hold Ether or ETH to pay for gas, easing their onboarding process and improving user acquisition and experience. However, while the relayers in the <a href="./gsn.html">GSN</a> do not charge users, they charge the recipient and contract instead. In this way, the relayers recover the costs of transactions and profit from extra fees for providing such services. Originally conceived and designed by TabooKey, the <a href="./gsn.html">GSN</a> has grown to encompass many companies, protocols and platforms in the <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> ecosystem that wish to facilitate the onboarding of users to <a href="./ethereum.html">Ethereum</a> applications.

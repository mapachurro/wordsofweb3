    <p id="definition"><strong>Definition:</strong> A blockchain explorer is an application, most often a website along with a corresponding API, that displays information about blockchain activity in a more human-friendly way. While a blockchain is designed to keep information forever, and be “readable by anyone”, finding the specific information you’re interested in may require indexing data off the blockchain–that is, sorting it according to given categories (sender address, token type, etc) into a separate database which can then be queried by the user; this essential function is provided by blockchain explorers. A prominent example is etherscan, which also offers explorers on a number of other networks.</p>
